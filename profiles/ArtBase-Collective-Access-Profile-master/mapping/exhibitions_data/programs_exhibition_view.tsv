This exhibition constitutes an expansion of Rhizome's mission to connect art and technology. The artists comment on systems, in their various forms and themes, with works ranging from computer, video, and electronic installations to drawings, paintings, and sculpture. Here, technology is not the sole tool or object at play, but is often an indirect subject -- a backdrop on the social landscape within which all art practice now occurs.  The harmony or dischord between these installations pinpoint areas of overlap between the various systems now navigated by each of us living in a technological society.  The show is, thus, an update on the established field of 'systems art,'  from the perspective of contemporary culture and practice.</p> <p> This exhibit is part of the 2006 Scope-New York Art Fair.</p>"	0	0	"Cinemascope Gallery"	""	""	"New York"	""	"New York"	"US"	""	NULL	"2006-03-10 00:00:00"	"2006-03-13 00:00:00"	"2010-08-24 11:52:09"	"2011-06-28 11:46:41"	1	"all-systems-go"	""	""	""	""	"programs/exhibition/All-Systems-Go!/ALLSYSTEMSGO_250x250_250x250.jpg"	"programs/exhibition/3/all_systems_go_thumbnail.jpg"

Rhizome introduced splash pages to its web site in 1998 in order to display artwork with greater immediacy. Splash art occupied the entire browser window, and the works were not indexed by prefaces, links, and thumbnails as art usually was on Rhizome and other sites. When the artwork appeared, the only clue to its authorship was in an extension of Rhizome’s URL, a structural necessity that also served a community-building function. Not only did the splash project create a more direct platform for showcasing work, it also defined a circle of artists by connecting their name to Rhizome’s in the location bar and forging a direct bond between their art and Rhizome’s home page.  </p>    <p><strong><i>Splashback: Rhizome's Splash Pages, 1998-2002</i></strong> is an online exhibition featuring 39 splash pages commissioned over a four-year period. <strong><i>Splashback</i></strong> offers a brief overview of online art and design practices from ten years ago through a nearly obsolete medium, the splash page.</p><p style = \"font-size:11px;\">Image: Mark Tribe, Alex Galloway, and Martin Wattenberg, <i>Starry Night</i>, 1999</p>"	0	1	""	""	""	""	""	NULL	NULL	""	NULL	"2009-04-01 00:00:00"	"2009-04-30 00:00:00"	"2010-08-24 12:46:39"	"2011-06-28 11:42:39"	1	"splashback-rhizomes-splash-pages-1998-2002"	""	""	""	"<p>Annie Abrahams, Daniel Garcia Andujar, Ben Benjamin, heath bunting, Gregory Chatonsky, Shu Lea Cheang, Andrew Childs, Curt Cloninger, David Crawford, Mark Daggett, Joshua Davis, entropy8zuper, Andrew Forbes, Valery Grancher, Matthew Hoessli, Olia Lialina, David Lindeman, jimpunk, JODI, Yael Kanarek, Lucas Kuzma, Antonio Mendoza, Mouchette, MTAA, Robbin Murphy, Nettmedia, Scott Paterson, Pavu, Waldemar Pranckiewicz, Reinis, Satellite01, Sigma6, Starry Night, Eugene Thacker, Jake Tilson, Maciej Wisniewski, Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries</p>

The central question that the exhibition poses is whether or not artists working with the internet are in fact limited to a “ready-made” color palette, a premise that many artists working with film, photography, and mass produced, standardized paint sets have assumed. The rationale for this question stems from theories of perception that argue that color is a not ready-made object found in a paint set or machine, but rather it is an experience that results from a complex process of light interacting with the retina and human nervous system.</p>

As a painter might pull imagery from the paint, the map as a birds-eye-view is a locative tool, which allows artists to playfully or poetically free information about physical and psychological space.\"</p>

The show is entitled \"Raiders of the Lost ArtBase\" and is curated by Michael Connor, Curator at FACT in Liverpool.

Unlike past exhibitions, \"Raiders of the Lost ArtBase\" takes the form of a blog. Connor \"will be tunneling into the Rhizome ArtBase until his eyes bleed, hunting for buried treasures both ancient and new,\" selecting works sequentially, over the course of several weeks, and posting them to the \"Raiders\" website. Here, viewers may not only browse the evolving exhibition, but also add to it by interjecting comments about the works. Viewers may also receive the exhibition in a live, distributed format by syndicating it or subscribing to its RSS feed:

The first work Connor has unearthed is \"Zombie and Mummy\" (2002), Dragan \"Drax\" Espenschied (DE) and Olia Lialina’s (RU) serial comic strip about two ancient misfit-buddies looking for hobbies and meaning on the Internet and elsewhere. Drax is also responsible for the epic design of \"Raiders of the Lost ArtBase,\" which is a vertically scrolling tour from the gif-strewn cosmos to the seventh circle of ArtBase hell. \"Scrolling is good,\" explains Drax, \"because people need more exercise.\""	0	1	""	""	""	""	""	NULL	NULL	""	NULL	"2005-03-01 00:00:00"	NULL	"2012-09-21 18:09:19"	"2012-09-21 18:10:47"	0	"raiders-of-the-lost-artbase"	""	""	""	""	""	"programs/exhibition/Raiders-of-the-Lost-ArtBase/raiders_thumbnail.jpg"
