Alter Ego investigates the familiar sense of being outside of (beside) oneself, and plays with the experience of a loss of control over an aspect of the self. Using a computer to produce a semi-autonomous replica of the person sitting in front of it, Alter Ego invites individuals to question the various facets of their own identity.  Alter Ego investigates the familiar sense of being outside of (beside) oneself, and plays with the experience of a loss of control over an aspect of the self. Using a computer to produce a semi-autonomous replica of the person sitting in front of it, Alter Ego invites people to question the various facets of their own identity.  In the installation, a stool with a curved black screen behind it is placed 1.5 metres in front of something that appears to be a mirror hanging on a wall. If you sit still on the stool with a blank expression on your face the computer will capture your image via a webcam located behind the ‘mirror'. Using data gathered from these captured images, the system reorganises a stored 3D model to look like you. As the computer is working you will see an image which forms your own ‘reflection’, mirroring your own facial expressions. After about thirty seconds this reflection begins to react to, rather than mirror, your expressions. For example: if you smile, the virtual face, or ‘alter ego’, may look surprised or angry, or may smile back. This dialogue continues until the system detects that the face has moved outside its field of vision, at which time it is reset. The interface is designed to be automatic and invisible - it does not require conscious intervention (such as button pushing/touch screen etc). Alter Ego has a secondary audience comprised of those people who have already used the work, or who are waiting to use it, and who are discussing their ‘performance’. The face of the Alter Ego appears like, but not exactly like, that of the user. Its facial expressions mimic those of the user, but they are not quite right. It is this gap that renders the work both intriguing and compelling. This gap introduces a sense of rupture between the observed self and the experienced self. At the same time, it points up the inseparability of human and machine; of conscious actions and affective responses. Alter Ego plays with our expectations, drawing attention to the subtle relationship between technological development and the transformation of human self-image and identification.Alter Ego was made in collaboration with Professor Alf Linney at University College London. the project was supported by Arts Council England Touring and an Impact Award from the Wellcome Trust.",12/3/05 13:53,http://www.alteregoinstallation.co.uk/,outside_link,,archive_URL,arr,Date created: 2005,12/3/05 13:53,,,"Collaborative, interactive, identity, installation, interface, live, machine, participatory, avatar, automatic, real time, emotion, affect"46890,Arabesque,Peter William,Holden,Peter William Holden,"In my recent work I have concerned myself not only with the sculpting of three dimensions but also with a fourth: the dimension of time. I have attempted to create work that evolves, adapts and regresses. Work which falls somewhere between conventional notions of pictorial art and a kind of performance. “Arabesque” is the natural continuation of this exploration – a real time animation.With its roots in Mary Shelly’s “Frankenstein” and the alchemist’s laboratory, the installation presents itself as a mechanical flower: a simulacrum of nature. Life sized human body parts, impaled upon steel, move and sway and dance. The limbs, translucent and livid, bare their internal robotic mechanisms to the gaze of the viewer. The wiring itself is an aesthetic expression deliberately integrated into the installation to bring chaotic lines of abstract form to contrast with the organized symmetry of the body parts. The lifeblood of this organism is air and when activated this air flows invisibly, bestowing movement to these mechanisms and its presence is only betrayed when exhaled loudly from the valves attached to the serpentine air hose. This combined with the rattle of relays and the tandem clattering of pistons to produce a hyper-modern accompaniment to the music of Strauss.Part cinema, part theatre, “Arabesque” can be viewed form a multitude of angles, revealing a kaleidoscope of beautiful shapes and patterns created from the human form. mechanical kaleidoscopeComposite Plastic, Steel, Industrial Computer, Compressed Air Components4.5m x 4.5m x 1.5m",6/18/07 0:00,http://www.peter-william-holden.com/data/video/arabesque.mp4,outside_link,,archive_URL,arr,,6/18/07 0:00,,,"kinetic art, installation art, choreography, animation, robotic art, audio visual, robotic art, sculpture, robot, dance, machine, sculpture, new media art, installation art, movement, installation, choreography, robotic art, Sculpture, installation, performance, robot, installation art, Kinetic Sculpture, "38076,AutoGene,Peter William,Holden,Peter William Holden,"physical animationUmbrellas, Steel, Industrial Computer, Compressed Air Components4.5m x 4.5m x 0.8m Within movement lies beauty but that very movement begets destruction.

The circular arrangement combined with the striking contrast produced as the umbrellas expand and contract engender the formation of abstract ephemeral patterns, which are seemingly governed by the accompanying music.

This sent the designating wand of the readymade into undelineated dimensions of time and space. Added to life-time now, is its double, net-time. The webcam replaces the artifice of digital video as a real-time source for artwork, transforming a utopian technological desire for transoptic vision into a slow pulsing succession of grainy frames and the long uneventful moments between spectacles. The banal object, the empty room, and the darkened city tap into the pulse of telepresence, its cycling from being to absence. In other avenues this new surveillance medium extends the optic pleasures of cultural taboo, the sublime distant landscape, the dissolution of private and public spheres. But almost by accident, with staggered frame, the low tech image feed becomes an relentless entrancing and problematic witness, unveiling an Internet subconscious beneath the proliferation of virtual institutions. The magic of telepresence evokes the fundamental questions of existence and subjecthood.“Rendezvous”: Duchamp’s allusion to the artwork as encounter points towards a generative moment produced by considerations of chance, internal attractions and the construction of meaning. The webcam is most readily understood as surveillance technology, providing voyeuristic pleasure and feeding the problematics of expanding control societies. As image recognition emerges as the next technology of vision control, my work attempts to reposition the problematics of webcam surveillance into the productive gestures (modes) of identification, coincidence and consultation.With this in mind, my work operates through a series of inquiries, observations, interactions and re-presentations of particularly chosen existing worldwide webcams and installed alterations and configurations of my own design. The format of this work has involved video installation, performance, serial objects, inkjet transparencies and most recently coinciding network/physical spaces. Breathe On Me is an installation/internet work consisting of a three-walled space with a number of hybrid fan/webcam devices affixed to the walls. The ""FanCam"" devices are modified netcams such that Internet users can control the direction of the fan from the remote webcam view combined with pan and tilt controls. Internet users can choose one of the devices in the space, log onto a FanCam, visually locate visitors in the physical space and then turn on the fan and ""breathe"" towards the person. Visitors in the physical space are invited to enter a space where they will be remotely seen and will not know who is telepresent. Once seen by internet participants, they will receive an offer of fan “breath’ as a fundamental form of communication. Visitors who enter the space are asking to receive a telepresent stranger’s touch in the form of wind.

Nelson, Jr.","Constructed Identities Statement:The Constructed Identities project had its first realization on Saturday August 10, 2002 in Atlanta, GA as a part of Shedspace, a series of artist installations in backyard sheds around Atlanta during the month of August. This particular one was in the shed of Sean Borja, a graphic designer for Home Depot and board member of Eyedrum art & music gallery. The installation is accessed by a log-in sheet on the door which viewers must create an i.d. and password in order to proceed. Once inside, there are four portraits of people from on-line dating services who use particularly interesting log-in names. Their portraits were taken from the site, pixelated, and then translated into six foot by six foot paintings using Ralph Lauren paint samples from Home Depot with colors based on 16-bit computer graphics. One of the portraits is interactive, meaning that the paint chips can be taken off and moved around to distort the image or to create a new image all together. Picking up where the Charles Nelson Project left off, this project was an attempt to physically represent the process of creating personae and crafting our representations on the internet. In this case, the names that people choose for themselves as the first indicator of personality to a prospective mate are entrances into their way of thinking. Along with the concept of naming, this project deals formally with the idea of painting and the way many of us relate to paint in a non-artistic way. The paint samples that people collect to find a perfect shade of mint green are used as the material for creating an original piece of art work. So these are ""paintings"" because they are made up of representations of ""paint"". Yet these representations of paint display their own identity by showing the name of the exact color that they are (Bone Black, Petunia Blossom, Dressage Red, etc).This project is a continuation of my investigation of the role of traditional painting in a world of new technologies. The digitized image has become such a part of our reality that it is now understood as a visual language. My goal, ultimately, is to make art about our interface with technology using a language that we can all understand.",8/10/02 0:00,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/22567/,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/22567/,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,Date created: 2002-08-10,8/10/02 0:00,,,"art world, Atlanta, Charles Nelson, charleshnelson.com, commercialization, Conceptual, contextual, digital, Flash, HTML, identity, installation, Internet, Joey Orr, offline, posthuman, Readymade, Sean Borja, Shedspace, shedspace.org, social space, Visual"50264,Green,Shawn,Decker,Shawn Decker,"Green is an electro-acoustic sound installation which isolates the elements of rhythm and spatial orientation, using many small speakers as sound sources, with only the most basic of sounds (small clicks and pulses) to create a spatially and rhythmic studies that are based on the natural soundscapes of insects and other organisms found in meadows and fields. Green uses home-made and custom programmed microcontrollers - single chip computers - to generate all sound that is heard.

Their purpose is to be reserved indefinitely for use within drama or film productions so that unsuspecting people aren't disturbed by inquisitive viewers.Nation states organise telephone systems with 'numbering plans', identifying geographical areas or service operators with number prefixes and corresponding number ranges. Some plans hold – forever-reserved – ranges of numbers varying from one hundred (some states of the USA) though to one hundred thousand consecutively ordered (Ireland). Explicitly for use in film and television programmes, producers pick from the designated ranges. The chosen digits appear fleetingly in films, or frequently over years of a serial.Enquires were made to the telecommunication regulators of each nation state.

Zbyszyński ,"PacketWeather is a visualization and sonification of the data traffic that continuously surrounds us. Every second, computers are sending information “packets” out into the ether. These might be low level, such as checking the time on the network, or part of a storm of bits that represent email or html web browsing. While action is initiated by the user in the latter case, it can be surprising how much communication is generated automatically and occurs beneath the surface. Not only are data packets passing around us on wires, they are also passing straight through us as part of wireless data networks that are becoming ubiquitous. PacketWeather exposes part of the ocean of data that we are currently immersed in, but are usually unaware of.PacketWeather employs Carnivore (officially DCS1000), a network “diagnostic” tool that the FBI has used to sniff out internet packets. Carnivore has been ported to run in Processing, an open source image, animation, and data visualization environment. It is here that the IP addresses and port numbers, of incoming packets are examined, and plotted visually. The spatial location of the plots corresponds to the IP addresses of the sender and receiver, while the color of the plots indicates what kind of traffic that packet represents (blue is html, red is instant messaging, green is email, etc.) Processing then packages this information into the OpenSoundControl, a communications protocol that originated in music synthesis. This protocol is passed along to Max/MSP, a data-flow based audio programming environment. Max keeps a running histogram of what packets have been seen, and uses that to generate a sonic environment based on the current packet climate. Repeated ports become more prominent, and different packet types (UDP or TCP) are identified by individual timbres.PacketWeather is both site and time specific. Since it picks up all the traffic on the local area network, it can be extremely dense and active on a large network and much more minimal in a home environment. The nature of the prevailing traffic also influences the moment-by-moment evolution of the environment, and is strongly determined by the specific activities of users on the network. PacketWeather is a multimedia installation that visualizes and sonifies the data traffic that continuously surrounds us: every second, computers are sending information “packets” out into the ether.

The gallery was pitch black and could only be traversed using a torch that was handed to audience members as they entered the space. For the past 60 years, AUDiNT has been conducting research, rituals, and experiments into the opening of the 3rd ear, a dimension that is opened when sound, ultrasound, and infrasound are simultaneously deployed in a precise schema of sequencing, duration, and amplification. The 3rd ear forms a conduit for the channelling of voices and frequencies, allowing communication between the living and the dead, sanity and insanity and between disparate locations in space and time. Ever since AUDiNT’s defection from the U.S. military at the end of WWII, our mission has been to submerge the frequency-based phenomenon that had been accidentally discovered by the Ghost Army (when they deployed 3 turntables to fabricate deceptive soundscapes intended to deceive the Nazi’s as to the true numbers and whereabouts of the allied forces). Wishing to keep this powerful sonic weapon out of government and military hands, AUDiNT’s founding members smashed the original battlefield discs, and split the waveformed content of the original master recordings into small packages of sound which were then discretely embedded into sound effects and stereo fidelity records.Throughout the following decades AUDiNT were responsible for the mass production of the test tone record and special effects vinyl - a collection that ended up in flee markets, thrift stores and church bazaars, forming what is known as ‘The Dead Record Network’. It was through the Dead Record Network that we distributed these encrypted recordings as an open secret, ensuring that, in the future, the vital bits of analogue information concerning the ultimate vibrational weapon discovered during WWII would remain in a fragmented social circulation.  Adapting to the tactical battlefields of the 21st century networks, capitalizing on the viral dynamics of digital networks, we are systematically uploading our research archive that has been compiled throughout the past 60 years (while probing the hauntological power of sonic weaponry). This ritualized uploading of the spectral archive aims to create a prospective archive of waveformed affect that is propagated throughout the living dead networks of our communication systems. This tactical shift - to open up our archive to the public - relates to our new mandate of arming the mass populace with the efficacy of sonic weaponry so that it does not become the sole preserve of the military-entertainment complex. With its dark science and sonically dissonant content, AUDiNT’s 'Dead Record Office' is the enshrined location from which this viral transfer begins.The GhostCoder software that we produced for the 'Dead Record Office' is an encryption utility used to embed sound files or spoken text files within flac music files using spectral analysis to encode the research beyond the listeners hearing range. This information piggybacks on top of popular music files and torrents without being noticed, thus creating a networked distribution as an archival method of important information. The information or the torrent stream can then be decoded with the GhostCoder to yield the embedded information. The GhostCoder is intended to use viral dynamics as an archiving tool to ensure important data stays within the public domain.

Site specific video installation | 2007Computer, video projector, surround sound system, lightning system, DMX dimmer, motion detector. Tunnel Vision is a multimedia installation that consists of a video projection, surround sound and lighting effects. The imagery was created using 3D modeling and animation. The work is a visual and auditory experience of spatiality. It was produced specifically for the Centre and seeks to explore the body's experience and the sensory effects of industrial architecture.The building which houses the art centre is rudimentary and functional in its structure. As in most old factories, the inside spaces are relatively anonymous and impersonal. There is very little in the room to trigger any associations. The emptiness in it thus becomes strangely present and takes on another dimension, suggesting an infinite identical space and a vertiginous depth. This absence is like a desert of the interior. Usually an installation inhabits the space, but here the work disappears, or rather, it is the space itself that manifests through the work. Before entering the room, the visitor sees a dimly lit video still and hears an almost inaudible rumble. The projection creates the illusion that the room is much deeper and curved, like a tunnel or long corridor, than it actually is. When the viewer enters the room, the visual and sound environment changes. The still image starts moving, giving the impression that one is travelling along a winding passage. The rumble becomes louder and stronger. The projection gradually becomes brighter as the sound increases in volume. When both sound and light reach a saturation point, a set of lights illuminates the room. The rumble travels past the visitor and fades away. The light also disappears, and silence takes over.As the title suggests, the work explores ideas associated with the process of immersive perceptual awareness. It sets up an environment that confronts us with visual and auditory stimuli which are at times soothing and at other times disturbing. Because the installation plays with basic physical reflexes and primary sensations, the visitor is brought to a more primitive level of awareness. Experiencing the effects of strong light on our eyes or low rumbling noises on our ears, we are taken to the limits of human sensory capacitiesThe soundscape is a response to the qualitative dimensions of the space and echoes the minimalist architecture of the building. Listeners are invited to immerse themselves in an experience of primal acoustic events.
