Two spaces in the shape of a sphere shelter two artists who devote themselves to a play in which they are the others living doll.Inside their tents they are face to face via a system of two webcams. The public can follow the hidden face to face via an interface that permits to project the webcam images of the two artists side by side on the wall behind the tents.As in a virtual world (a video game, Second Life) the artists give orders to their avatar played by the other. But contrary to what happens in the virtual world, here the alter ego is well alive. It has its own capacities and it can agree or not to give flesh to the projections of the other.Annie Abrahams and Nicolas Frespech comment on the present situation where we tend more and more to live in our own bubble, our own sphere, without need for the other, by forming a couple with our virtual doubles.",5/26/07 0:00,http://bram.org/confront/sphere/indexeng.html,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"Appended Tech Details=====================special webcam performance interface made by Clement Charmet",5/26/07 0:00,,,"Alejandro Delgado Gomez, Annick Rivoire, Artistic collaboration, Centre Pompidou, Clement Charmet, Cyril Thomas, Flashfestival, Internet, intimacy, Nicolas Frespech, panoplie.org, Paris, Poptronics, Ruth Catlow, torrent p2p, Virtual reality, webperformance, webcam performance"
