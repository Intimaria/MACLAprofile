What is an author? Does the Reader become a Wreader? The project was produced in 2003 for the Austrian broadcasting company’s (ORF) 'Kunstradio' and is accessible on the Internet. The Famous Sound started with one work of digital literature per artist, to which another artist in the group reacted with a printable text. The text material created in this way was then processed by a human editor (Auer) and a text machine and finally performed in this version by two speakers for the radio program. Furthermore, six new pieces of digital literature were produced by the artists involved, as a reaction to this process.

It provides the user with the opportunity to create the self-portrait, and then, if they wish, erase it.  This work is a commentary on the tradition of self-portraiture and its ongoing evolution in a digital age. 

""Because You Asked"" is created entirely in Flash, and uses a synthesized combination of text, images, and audio to complete the self-portrait.  The piece is interactive, and requires that the user click on a series of buttons, appearing as icons, to proceed through the work.  It is only through the user's participation that the self-portrait can be completed, and once completed, the user has the option, through tools provided on the site, to erase it.

The purpose of the work is two-fold.  
First, it is a commentary on the tradition of self-portraiture, and how that tradition has evolved within the technological parameters of new media.  In particular, the web--especially through the use of applications like Flash--offers the possibility of a self-portrait being not only a multi-media event, but also an event which involves audience participation.  The act of self-portraiture is, by definition, a solitary act, but with the web as a venue, it becomes a cooperative act.  In this case, the cooperative act completes a portrait that, although already stored within the Flash movie, cannot play until prompted by outside intervention.  The user becomes the ""painter"" of the portrait, and as with all artists, at the end has the option to erase the work they have created.

Secondly, this piece is a commentary on language, and how language--self-descriptive words, phrases, and concepts--becomes a summation, an expression of the self.  In ""Because You Asked,"" this language of self-expression finds its visual equivalent in text, that through masking effects in Flash, fills in a photographic rendering of the artist.  There is no self-identification without language, and the end result (the completed self-portrait) fills only a temporary space on the virtual page, until it is erased, and thereby deconstructed.",9/12/07 0:00,http://www.webyarns.com/BecauseYouAsked.html,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,,9/12/07 0:00,,,"digital fiction, Flash, Hypertext, Interactive, interactive stories, Internet, multimedia, Narrative, story, Text, webyarns.com"45661,"""Outskirt""",Lacie,Garnes,Lacie Garnes,"The “Outskirt” project is a study of the private vs. the public body. I gather information using surveillance technologies similar to those utilized in capturing voyeuristic material known as “up-skirting”. Voyeurism is a class C felony, however, there exists a loophole stating that the prosecution of “up-skirt” voyeurs is unconstitutional due to the confines of what determines private and public space. Because these images are taken in public places, the photographer cannot be tried under voyeur law.

While this statement gives reasons why the project was developed (legislation/ social structures/ voyeurism), what became really compelling was that the video footage collected, as a result of my framing device (between my legs, gazing out from my skirt), had such a strong feminine presence. This device charges the piece, and the mundane surveillance footage, sexually. The aperture quivers open and shut, much like that of an orifice. And while the camera was on my body, an assumption is made that the camera was inside my body. This work reveals what it looks like, feels like, to be a woman in public space. At times, unavoidably vulnerable, unavoidably exposed.,

Combined live webcams from New York and Boston, GENCO GULAN, 2002.


After 9/ 11 suddenly all the planes that I see on the sky started to remind me of the crash. And the crash reminds me the organic smell that invaded Manhattan and than my painfull throat. After I left the city, planes not only started to remind me of 9/11, but also New York. 

""Whenever I see a plane I remember the smell..."" is a net-art piece dedicated to all victims of 9/ 11. The project is composed by combining two seperate groups of live web cams from New York City and Boston airport. The cams form New York City were from Times Square live, located on the left and cams from Boston were showing Logan Airport, located on the right. (The live cams are originally from www.earthcam.com and www.livewave.com) Boston's Logan Airport is important as the two flights that had struck the World Trade Center on 9/11 were from Logan airport and Times Square was choosen as the symbol of NYC.

Multiple live cams, when combined together, makes a single different dynamic image. Cams together creates a different visual perception and a different watching experience. When you watch a movie you always expect something striking to happen immediately. Live cams are different, in this regards, normally one uses them to Watch (or control) and not necessaryly to see. Still when you put together more than one live cam , the human brain automatically starts to correlates the images with each other. In case of ""Whenever I see a plane..."" project, the planes started to remind us NYC and the NYC starts to remind us the planes.",9/11/02 0:00,http://istanbulmuseum.org/cam.html,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: 9/11, web-cam

It puts us into a trance...indeed, time stops briefly as we intuitively soak in its perfection. The geometry draws us back...to the source...the DNA...and its incessant need to clone itself. The expression...the little, and sometimes not so little, distortions of that geometry...is what draws us human.

A new ""upgraded"" version of this work with animations (""Your sFace or Mine? Anonymity"") can be found at"" http://www.brooksdesign-ps.net/Reginald_Brooks/Code/Html/5face/netart15.htm In the simplest means I have endeavored to create a lively, interactive palette whereby you can express yourself.

Personally, the human face is the single most intriguing image I can place on my retinas, closely followed, and of course sometimes exchanged for, the image of the human form...and we each have our preferences here. Without a doubt, we are hardwired so...as a crow for another crow.

What amazes me is how endlessly fascinating what seems to be an almost endless number of facial types and the facial expressions which can flash across...all this from just changing a few of the parts here and there...a corner of the mouth, the flare of the nostrils, the angle of the ears, the flow of the nose, the texture of the skin, and so on. Who has not seen in another, often familiar, face...let alone your own , either frozen like a zombie or animated as if you had a glowplug stuck up...that appears soft, lovely, full of warmth, beauty and love in one frame, only to transform into a conniving, greedy swine in another.

Yes, indeed, the neural net behind the retina that perceives the facial image comes into question, yet it is the endless variations on these handful of facial elements which is transmitting them...with its own neural net partially at the controls...that holds my fascination.

Again, Nature gives us a vast terrain of incredible richness constructed out of a few elements given slight variations and endless combinations. And now we come to the essence of this journey...the parts to the whole.

The parts to the whole...it is what drives our science, is fundamental to the arts,  and often given to faith elsewhere. In our quest to understand it all...the whole universe(s)...all of life...the human body...the genome within...we are by design and without other recourse examining, studying, manipulating, cloning and exchanging the parts. It's all about the parts. It's really all about the whole, but all the talk and efforts are about the parts. It's one big swapmeet.

Swapping parts out on your computer is one thing, swapping out DNA sequences in your body...let alone your food...is a lot more exciting. Remember the whole. The parts serve the whole. Trouble signs appears when the opposite rules.

If modernism was a return to first principles (""art for art's sake""), post-modernism was not just a reaction to or a new branch from the old classical tree, but really a new seedling altogether. It anticipated and marked the beginning of a new age of discovery. What happens when you place or exchange new parts...often similar, but more often not...with the old? Do you get a new whole? A new view of the old whole? Is the unity of Nature inviolate...or is it much, much wider than our own limitations have imagined? Should limited imaginations constrain?

That seedling is growing into a full-fledged trunk (post-post-modernism or some other -ism) anticipating what science is discovering...that we are just part of the parts manipulating the parts and just part of the recipient of those cloned, modified, manipulated parts and that the only way we can really thrive and enjoy this whole swapmeet is to get really, really informed by global education and communication.

There are many beautiful faces...in fact most every face has its own beauty being taken from the same basic template. And you may want to have one just like the idealized one(s) formed or transformed here from the original (or maybe you prefer your neighbors). 

The ideal face (and the ideal body, too)  is perhaps the simplest, most even and symmetrical realization of the concentric series of double pentagons which inform the geometric template upon which it is based...the very same template which informs the structural beauty of the axial-viewed DNA molecule itself.

Perfect geometry is like what they say of perfect architecture...it is ""frozen music."" It puts us into a trance...indeed, time stops briefly as we intuitively soak in its perfection. The geometry draws us back...to the source...the DNA...and its incessant need to clone itself. The expression...the little, and sometimes not so little, distortions of that geometry...is what draws us human.

Each day the chat room would be open to the public to discuss a topic of Vicker's picking, usually related to the political and psychological impacts of immersed technology in popular culture. At the end of each day vickers would build upon a net sculpture that would represent the day's discussions and conclusions. Randomly Vickers would act out small scripts within the chat room. The project was also home to a few lecture series given by Vickers to a private audience. 4eva connected is an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) site featuring daily events, performances, lectures and massive chill sessions. The front page presents a calendar, with each day passing a new sculpture will appear and the chat will take a different direction. Each sculpture will be an evolved version of the previous, constructed by the direction of conversation and aura of the chat room from the previous day. The sculpture will be displayed each day in its altered state alongside a form of documentation of the occurrence that most greatly impacted it's formation. The chat room will be closed occasionally for private events.

Vickers encourages individuals and groups to use the chat room as a performative space, as he himself and other artists (including Ito & Denny) will be every day. Through the use of triggered word simulations, loosely scripted narratives and reenactments of seminal performative artworks, being aware of the chat rooms intentions and realities will be a challenging experience of groundlessness.

A New Alphabet: Language, Embodiment and Digital Literacy is a monograph of approximately sixty-five pages, organized as an alphabet primer on the subject of embodiment in an experimental essay employing pictographic language, poetry and commentary.  The divergent format engages theoretical lexicons of meaning, literally, literately and figuratively in an ever-widening circle of discourse. 

Taking the premise that iconographic language reconfigures standardized treatments of printed matter; the visually complex and sometimes stunning alphabet pages evoke new contexts of reading. 

Hovering on the border between digital and analog modes of reading (viewing) and writing (text/content production), A New Alphabet experiments with formats in page design and assemblage of image and text to constitute new lexicographical relations.  The thirty alphabet pages are displayed on the right page (recto) with commentary on the left page (verso). The divergent left and right page format may suggest the dichotomy of brain hemispheres. 

Eschewing rational understanding the alphabet pages cast doubt on conventions of academic discourse, inviting intuitive reading/viewing of the subject within the mindscape of the viewer. This work is interested in the evolution of consciousness and how changes in the mechanics of the recording, and reading of collective cultural material, interact with the mechanics of perception, thought apprehension and concept recognition 

As an exploration of an evolution in process, A New Alphabet is both experiential and theoretical in its presentation emphasizing how visual images become encoded characters in a new alphabet of collective reference, as an effect of postmodern and digital culture.  

Theories of embodiment have now become the locus of post-post-structuralism discourse mitigated by the eluvium of new media.  A historical parallel between the current technological revolution and the enlightenment with the invention of the printing press, is  observed.  In both periods a heightened interest in embodiment occurs and this may be a marker of cultural transition.  

This work traces the current interest in the body back to the 1960s beat and avant-garde movements.  The academy  articulates cultural movements.  A New Alphabet observes how the term embodiment becomes a buzzword or metaphor in postmodern discourse and  
catalogues several facets of embodiment theory including: Charles Peirce's philosophy of the mechanics of mind and the works of Charles Lakoff with Mark Johnson (The Body in the Mind).  

New theory on cognition and perception such as Mary Barry?s Visual Intelligence that explore relationships between language and cognition, inform this new alphabet. The work also reviews editorial studies of how text is embodied on the page with the research of Jerome McCann (The Rossetti Archive online), Johanna Drucker (The Visible Word) and George Bornstein and Theresa Tinkle (The Iconic Page). 

The metaphor of the body is a unifying graphic feature of the alphabet. Images from fine art are transposed into icons of the human body to make a visual skin for the page text.  The western tradition of iconography and portraiture are noted. 

On the matter of language and alphabets this work briefly follows the archeology of linguistic migration to discover the present distillation of languages into a global standard using English.  As this standard is formalized, the simultaneous emergence of iconography indicates the instability of trends in language migration. 

Gender studies fostered several theories about embodiment.  The Cyborg theory of Donna Haraway (The Cyborg Manifesto), Katherine Hayles? (How We Become Posthuman) and Informatics theory are contrasted with the body-centered approach of  Nicole Brossard (Picture Theory) and Luce Irigaray (Speculum). 

Several discussions of digital culture are followed including Richard Grusin's and Jay Bolter's Remediation.  Lev Manovich's aesthetics of database and the anonymous Digital Manifesto claim the aesthetics of software logic is the signifying theoretical feature of digital culture.  

The representation of text in moving formats or cinetypography is introduced. 
Situated in the flux of new media this work demonstrates and reflects emerging modes without the limitations of specialization.  This long view scans the many nuances and facets of the prototypic digital culture as it evolves.

What would it look like through the eyes of a net.artist immitating the styles of other net.artists? See for yourself.

I like to think of the project as a commentary on the subversive nature of advertising and design markets, which usually hold direct opposition 
to the ideals of the avant garde. It is actually a piece of net.art backlash; it is a warning siren of sorts to illuminate the fact that net.art, like most art ""movements,"" can easily be used to serve a consumerist agenda. 

The Absolut campaign can be seen as a champion of the artists commission or the grandest, and most frustrating, union of art and commerce. The far reaching effects of Absoluts icon-making campaign is evident even in this piece; the absolut bottle is immediately recognizable, and in most cases more recognizeable than the artist.

Many users who encounter the work believe it to be the work of the ""authors"" attributed to it, but in fact all but one (Absolut Superbad, by Chris Stave) were created by myself. My favorite comment in response to the work was: ""I don't care who made it, its still JODI.""

It should also be noted that this artist would prefer a strawberry daiquiri, heavily abundant on sugar and toothpick umbrellas, over a bottle of vodka anyday, provided he was old enough to consume alchohol. Eryk Salvaggio's ""Absolut Net.Art"" project distills the personal stylistic tropes of a handful of standout net.art stars, effectively emulating their work through the template of absolut vodka advertisements. The project underlines the ease of style hijacking inherent in the digital realm.",8/19/01 19:44,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/1690/index.html,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,test,1/1/98 19:44,,,"Absolut Net.Art, Anti-art, art world, HTML, Visual"53698,Accident Airlines,Kim,Asendorf,Kim Asendorf,"A screen shot series documenting a manipulated webcam signal, captured by the artist.",12/9/11 14:06,http://kimasendorf.com/accident-airlines/,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/53698/kimasendorf.com/accident-airlines/,archive_URL,arr,,12/9/11 14:06,,,"Formalist, glitch, Readymade, webcam"53372,ADMVIII BOT,RYBN,,RYBN,"On May 6, 2010, around 2:40 p.m., the Dow Jones Industrial Average index fell about 900 points in less than twenty minutes. The loss was estimated at one trillion dollars. Following this event, all transactions made that day between 2:40 and 3 p.m. were canceled in joint agreement. This instantaneous stock market crash, which is now referred to as the “Flash Crash,” was caused by miscalculations carried out by high-frequency trading robots operating on the markets. Despite its virtuality, this crash sheds light upon the actual architecture of finance; its particular temporality and scale that reaches far beyond human physical abilities and perceptions, where robots trigger thousands of orders each second and flood the market with millions of fake information to hide their true investments, a process which is called “quote stuffing.” Engaging finance in its most recent and complex developments, RYBN has undertaken the construction of its own amateur trading bot, designed to invest and speculate on the financial markets. Its decisions are taken with the help of an internal algorithmic intelligence system, and can be influenced by a wide range of external arbitrary parameters. The whole decision system allows the program to foresee the next moves in the markets, while it tries to identify and anticipate the relevant and effective patterns within the financial chaotic oscillations. The performance stops when the robot reaches bankruptcy.

They are: Cindi, a digital designer in Irvine, Kentucky, who lives on a 27 acre farm at the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains; Adam, a environmental engineer from Northern California who specializes in the analysis and clean-up of hazardous waste sites; and Neil, who shares his recollections of growing up in an emerging New York City suburb on Long Island in the 1950's and 1960's. Woven together with ""visual"" quotes from 4 central themes -- seen[scene], use[re]use, permanence[im]permanence, and earth[un]earth -- this randomly accessed, non-linear work reveals the many different ""micro"" tales of specific places that exist within the larger American experience.

a. Assembly mobilizes the combined efforts of digital peers to critique an institution/individual/network’s website through the oppositional use of bandwidth squatting. For 13 days, participants vote to decide what institution/individual/network’s website will be the subject of this act. On the 14th day of Assembly– November 1st – Jstchillin.org will be replaced by a single page that features 25 iFrames constantly reloading the democratically decided website of political opposition. To drain the maximum amount of bandwidth or potentially freeze the website to a standstill, on November 1st we encourage you to open as many tabs of Jstchillin.org as possible and leave them open all day. In doing so, participants may group together to temporarily remove this website’s existence on the internet, putting a halt to its undesired effects on our community and the world at large. Bandwidth squatting is a method of protest, a tool historically linked with the Civil Rights Movement’s sit ins of the 1960’s. Through their undesired mass presence, protesters are able to disrupt the informational function of the website they are intervening on– a detournement of digital visitation.

a. Assembly mobilizes the combined efforts of digital peers in tributary celebration of an institution/individual/network’s website through a symbolicly supportive digital mass pilgrimage. For 13 days, participants vote to decide what institution/individual/network’s website will be the subject of this act. On the 14th day of Assembly– November 1– Jstchillin.org will be replaced by a single page that features 25 iFrames constantly reloading the democratically decided website of tributary celebration. To maximize the symbolic support for the decided website, on November 1st we encourage you to open as many tabs of Jstchillin.org as possible and leave them open all day. In doing so, participants may group together to create an honorific swell of attention, a mass of support for the legacy of the website’s effects on our community and the world at large. Digital mass pilgrimage is a method of praise that makes use of the fact that there is no such thing as negative attention online. Through bringing the website to a halt, tributary participants pose the undesired possibility of a world without the website– an eye-opening and appreciation-building event not unlike guardian angel Clarence Odbody’s intervention into George Bailey’s state of affairs in the movie It’s a Wonderful Life.

Introduction to Kristin Lucas's Between a Rock and a Hard Drive
by Sara Tucker

Parking lots, checkout lines, airports, shopping centers, and lobbies are among the backdrops Kristin Lucas employs in her project for Dia's web site, Between a Rock and A Hard Drive. The inanimate objects in these places of passage and waiting become the actors in Lucas's vignettes, reciting dialogue in speech bubbles and balloons culled by this young American artist from online chat transcripts. Surrounding each scene is a mutated keyboard which produces sound effects including audible fragments of chat and site-specific sounds. Unique audio compositions can be made with each move of the mouse. The only functions of the keyboard which remain constant from scene to scene are the escape key, which advances the viewer through each scene of a given waiting area (whether the Service Station, the Concourse, the Hospitality Suite) and the FAQ key. FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) pages are a common practice on websites and in newsgroups where answers are provided to frequently asked questions. Lucas's FAQ, however, tends to raise more questions than it answers. 

Like the adage her title plays off, Between A Rock and A Hard Drive sympathizes with those stuck with slow equipment, a slow network, or simply little patience. There are two equally unpleasant alternatives when dealing with the internet; waiting what seems like an eternity and then sifting through massive amounts of irrelevant junk, or going without the information required. By creating these 56 scenes, Lucas is offering, as she calls it, ""temporary housing for the despondent virtual citizen,"" a place to bide time while waiting for what is really needed: a waiting room appropriate for the internet. But on another level it celebrates the very indiscriminate, unpredictable and tentative nature of the online experience by making something playful out of one of its most popular components: chat. 

While chat rooms can be found virtually anywhere on the net, AOL is the king of chat. Logging onto their ""People Connection"" offers countless dozens of topics, with thousands of people divided among its chat rooms at any given time. This is an environment where redundancy, typos, incomplete sentences, and emoticons abound, and, as in classified ads, a language of shorthand is employed for common phrases. Trying to follow a single thread of discussion is a bit like watching for needles while the hay is bailed. 

As in graphical chat environments like the Palace, Lucas takes this found dialogue and places it in balloons set on top of an image of a ""real"" environment. But unlike the Palace, where visitors assume avatars to represent themselves, Lucas gives voice directly to the objects in the scenes, anthropomorphizing everything from sinks to lines drawn on a parking lot. This isn't a wild leap. The dialogue in the chat rooms is not only disembodied, it is usually attributed to usernames that bear no resemblance to human names, often a combination of letters and numbers that were randomly generated to assure a unique name, like jazzo3923. There is no way to tell if a message was posted by a male or female, adult or child, human or bot: is anyone in the room what they appear to be? Each chat encounter is potentially a mini Turing test: even the word ""be"" infers a congnizance among the participants that can't always be assumed. 

In her previous video and performance works, Lucas has addressed the anxiety, isolation and paranoia that has accompanied our shift to mediated communication, ubiquitous surveillance, video game culture, hallmarks of a society in which most of our vital information and systems are controlled by computers and networks vulnerable to viruses, hackers and internal flaws. But in this work, Lucas weaves together the conventions which have grown out of these systems to make something that takes them at their surface value, a value which Mark Taylor argues in his recent book ""Hiding"" is one which deserves a closer look. 

Taylor writes about the creative possibilities inherent in the proliferation of superficiality, a condition we find ourselves in when reality and image can no longer be differentiated. At one point he writes """,8/29/01 16:36,http://www.diacenter.org/lucas/index.html,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,,8/29/01 16:36,,,"Kristen Lucas, Dia, Between a Rock and a Hard Drive, allegory, audio, Flash, Visual"1696,Bindigirl,Prema,,Prema Murthy,"""By combining new media with performance and the material arts, I intend to

Bindigirl is a web project that questions our growing relationship with
distance and tele-erotics- tourism and intimacy.  It is based on what the
artist calls, Bindi, her ""avatar"" in screenal space.  Bindi is a construct
of fe/male desire, creatied out of what is deemed ""exotic"" and ""erotic"".
Bindigirl draws parallels between technology and religion and questions
these as a means for transcendence and the creation of a utopian space.

It explores how best to keep the content of these objects active, accessible and manageable for the (new) media artist both in the short term for use, reuse and manipulation, and in the long term as an archival resource.

If we do accept that over time and space we will lose some of our digital media objects - that they become inaccessible due to media obsolescence, corruption, or just physical misplacement, how best can we as creative individuals or small groups of artists and practitioners keep our content and minimize the loss of content within these objects?
The Blackaeonium project is an online, database-driven artwork and system that is both a keeping-place for digital media content, and a workspace or playground for developing new and recombinant content. The creation of this system has been informed by current new media theory and the continuum model being used by archival communities to allow preservation and access to records and artefacts in both the short and long term - across space and time. The system uses web 2.0 technologies common amongst systems such as blogs, forums, and tagging systems but also contains structural elements that are informed by international standards for archival description.

Over the course of one year, Brandon will be constantly ""processing"": it has been designed with holes and loops, and with events and venues that will allow participants from all parts of the world and netspace to shape and author the project.

Brandon's central themes, the complex ecologies of gender, sexuality, are threads taken from the life of Brandon Teena/Teena Brandon, a (real) woman who lived and loved as a  man in Falls City, Nebraska, USA. Brandon was raped and murdered in 1993 by two local men who discovered that ""he"" was a ""she.""

Brandon (the project) will explore a range of spaces, from online multiple user spaces (like chatrooms or avatars) to offline spaces like the Theatre Anatromicum, a Dutch new media performance venue once used for experimental
surgeries on prisoners.

Brandon also has a certain symbolic importance: as the first  Web site to be commissioned by the Guggenheim Museum, its production might signal a new point in the trajectory of internet art--internet art has reached a stage when museums and established art spaces and sponsors are interested in enough to   invest time and resources. This first installation of Brandon shows morphing gender signifiers, images of artifical and transformed physicality, and suggests a sense of impending violence and trouble.

its own self-enclosed inner space, with no windows onto its environs. One cannot miss the uncanny 
resemblance between Leibniz's ""monadology"" and the emerging cyberspace community in which global harmony
and solipsism strangely coexist. That is to say, does our immersion into cyberspace not go hand in hand 
with our reduction to a Leibnizean monad which, although ""without windows"" that would directly open up to 
external reality, mirrors in itself the entire universe? More and more, we are monads with no direct windows
onto reality, interacting alone with the PC screen, encountering only the virtual simulacra, and yet 
immersed more than ever into the global network, synchronously communicating with the entire globe.""

For me, the digital canvas is another representation tool. Browser is not only the way it looks but also

In the past, inherent trait of painting reveals through the recognitions and enactments of medium. 
As the tool and matarial,we have to reconsider the new medium.

My works are fuctioned both in the web and gallery context.
I am looking for an aesthetic capable of the new digital images in the postmodern period. 
Its fundamental category is the sublime. my aesthetic subject is the sublime. The significance of the sublime 
as an aesthetic subject of art seems to lie in its conceptual reach, or in the case of the religious sublime, 
in its spiritual dimension. The sublime refers to immense ideas like space, time, death, and the divine.

There exist something that cannot be represented in the dehors. When We feel the world beyond ,
we enter the realm of the sublime.To make visible that there is something which can be conceived and 
which can neither be seen nor made visible.we have the idea of the world,
but we do not have the capacity to show an example of it. The simulacra is as far removed from ‘reality’ as 
it is possible to be.But this true reality exists and is there awaiting discovery by us.
This would be a desire to seek permenance in the instable and forged world.

I want to invent new kind of space. this is the hybrid space and paradoxical space. virtuality, reality, transcendence...
We shall not attempt to define what is a virtual domain or a virtual world.
In Being and Time (1927) Heidegger claims that human life is characterized by the fact that we live 
within a field of given and open possibilities. To exist as a human being means having to construct our own life. 
We consider more and more the virtuality of computer to be the real thing. reality becomes a possible actualization of artificiality. 
To transcend means to go beyond. Maybe we discover that there is something beyond artificiality,
as there is also something-thing beyond nature or existence , not just the simple fact of being.

We actually receive vibrations from painting. these vibrations emanate from colors. 
my medium is light not painting and not sclpture. I began thinking in terms of light rather than color. 

light can let us experience transcendent power. light affects perception. 
in the beginning , there was light, simply light. the words""let there be light"" marked the begining of everything.
light is intrinsic to our physical and spiritual selves.
it gives us the power of vision. light has come to mean illumination and enlightenment, a possesion of
mind. that illumination is often spiritual in nature, applied to God as the source of devine light.

for centuries, ""devine light"" has streamed through stained glass into the interiors of churches.
A person who comes from the outside into the relative darkness of a cathedral is struck by the light pouring 
through the colored glass. Like a Rothko painting, mystical colors and luminosity create feeling of spirituality.
I want to create an atmosphere. wordless thouht that come from looking in a fire and the ocean ...


I am in the pursuit of new sublime sentiment in the new media place.
The New visual culture has changed our visual perception and cognition. 
Benjamin said that new media trains people’s perception through the simulation fitting the velocity of
the modern times. I am exploring a new sublime now found in technology with biblical event. 
In my work, Eternity and transcendency in the theological event are compatible with the temporality 
and existence derived from the influence of electronic media .

ASV [v.f.] 1.0 was performed on Sat March 23rd 2002 at 5 pm CET in the chatroom installed on www.amsterdameditions.com for the occasion during the Internet Fiesta and the Irish Museum of Modern Art's first open Net.art exhibition in which the website was involved.

The chatroom plays just slightly twist the original purpose of chatrooms. With ASV [v.f.] 1.0 (which in English should rather be ASL for Age, Sex and Location, the most basic self definition given by chatroom users to those they interact with) I intended to use a chatroom as a theater stage and asked professional actors along with some people having no acting experience to play a role we defined together. I am not a stage director myself and my aim was certainly not to play this role in the usual understanding of the word. Indeed, none of the actors' cues were pre-written and we had no rehearsal whatsoever. Furthermore, we never met before and even during the performance. Our communication only went through e-mails exchanged between the actors and myself. They were asked to define their own role and we built their character and personality together through e-mail exchanges from then on. No plot was defined prior to the performance : I was not interested in creating a linear fiction but rather a real time remote interaction between the actors. The time necessary for typing the cues (which varied from one actor to another depending on how fast they could type) generated delays in the answers to specific cues. This succession of unrelated cues could be read as something close to the ""cadavre exquis"" developped by the surrealists. Eventhough data was instantly transmitted simultaneously to all the actors' computer screens, the keyboard operating introduced a stretch, a delay preventing real time exchanges to be experienced. This paradoxical man/machine ability and time was, more than the content of the cues themselves, at the center of this work.

A nymphomaniac F1 pilot-suit designer from Texas, a retired colonial British Colonel, a young pretty utopian from Paris, a Sicilian gay and communist Earl, an artificial intelligence prototype developped by a Belgian scientist and a formerly imprisoned Viennese Actionnist converted to watercolor teaching for wealthy Americans in Provence were some of the characters of this absurd dialogue. Their conversation was engaged around a mysterious announcement made by Otto Weissmuller : ""Ms B. wants to die. The place is not too appropriate, we're not alone here."" Besides the defined characters, any member of the audience could decide to switch status and become actively involved in the play.

An international version performed by office workers during their work time is currently being prepared. Some of the next versions might also be experienced in already existing chatrooms which should result in a different type of interaction with an unwitting audience.

The play is edited in its full extend (in its original language : French) as an archive of a past event, the play was nevertheless obviously meant to be experienced as a ""live"" event.

3-D modelling is often aimed towards craftsmanship and realistic depiction of forms. On the other hand, there is a great potential to create forms that are beyond physical reality. In this project, I created 3-D objects that only exist within the laws of computer graphics. These objects express conceptual principles rather than describe realistic forms. I hope they will be an example of a kind of 3-D modelling that is oriented towards the conceptual and not the imitation of reality. Through this way of thinking about 3-D modelling, I wish to introduce a new set of geometry that is unique to the virtual computer environment.

Conceptual Objects were created using a 3-D modelling program. QuicktimeVR is used to allow viewers to rotate and examine the object from 360 degrees. Each object is slightly less than one megabyte in size so please allow time for it to load.

Rather, I am interested in investigating the intimate space around erotic activities and how these spaces move through and change with time.

(At least) two ""works"" in Beyond Interface--Homework and Desktopp IS--expand both the traditional notion of a collaboration--between and among artists, writers, designers, programmers--and what constitutes ""a work.""

Bookchin describes the genesis of Homework:

""It began as a homework assignment for a class i was teaching.
[Intro to Computing in the Arts. http://jupiter.ucsd.edu/~bookchin/syllabus.html]
Heath Bunting found the url from his server, because I had linked to a page
of his (he one you are including in your show).
he then posted my url on 7-11.

[a listserv http://www.vuk.org/7-11/]

you saw some of the mail that followed.

""Alexei asked me if some artists could  do the homework assignment for me, and they asked if i would grade it. I then received work from heath and vuk and alexei. I linked their projects to my homework page, posted grades and it continued from there.

[Final projects: http://jupiter.ucsd.edu/~bookchin/finalProject.html]

Alexei then sent out a call for artists to do the homework to a number of

art lists, like rhizome, nettime, and some others.

[Attention uncertified [net][internet][web] artists!]

So the project emerged collaboratively from discussions that took place on

7-11 and with the artists mentioned above and then other artists, mostly

from the 7-11 mailing list, began submitting work.

""Authorship is complicated enough when it revolves around issues of the collaborative possibilities of the Net [Bookchin, Shulgin], the increasing commodification of language [Andujar, Bunting], or the authorship of ""derivative"" texts [e.g. through viewer interactions, Biggs]. 

""It becomes even more layered with issues of the authenticity/anonymity of remote communications [see Bookchin's 'Artist Statement,' which is authored by an anonymous source who purported to be critic Peter Weibel], as well as the conscious role playing that the Net engenders [note for example, that in Bookchin's Grade/Evaluation of Keiko Suzuki, she writes ""woman to woman"" but links to ""The Transvestite Page."" And in her Grade/Evaluation of Rachel Baker, she writes: 'You would *almost* think that Keiko's work was done from a male perspective...'].""

As much as Homework raises all these issues in exemplary ways, perhaps the most fascinating negotiation is how Bookchin manages to actually grade and evaluate a number of net.art projects. While on the surface, it is all in good fun, Bookchin not only does grade the work (A-F) but manages to get in some succinct lectures about the three C's of the computer, throw her art history weight around, anoint a couple of new sub-genres of net.art, skewer net demi gods, and generally hold the line against work that does not meet the assignment. It is> good fun. It's also a lot to find out.

9-1-1 was a psychological trauma-bomb, exploding the complacent sea of consumerism with a shock-wave of violent proportions. From this initial blast, giant rolling waves rippled into Western consciousness, spreading out like tsunami, upsetting every area of life, dredging from the dark waters the deepest of questions: Why? But no answer came: these ripples returned ten-fold, the outgoing ripples were met by a foreign sea...forming a standing wave that threatened to obliterate all in its towering might.

The waves returned and they triggered anger, fear, and paranoia at the heart of the West. A blackhole filled the great beating heart of America and on its horizon flew the great Western unknown: the Middle East, the Terrorist, the nomad, hiding in caves and under tunnels, burrowed deep, both in the landscape of Afghanistan and the collective Western psyche.

If one were to set up a covert psychological operation to monitor and assess the psychological phenomenon of 9-1-1, one may end up considering the following dialogue:

Communication which pretends to say something, but does not. The substance seams meaningless and incomprehensible. The work interconnects abstract spam-mails text with schizophasia, an disorganized speech characteristic of schizophrenia. 

In the psychotic disorder of schiziphrenia, the ability to filter and process information is disturbed. Our brain normally acts as a filter for information from the senses, helping the brain pick out which nerve messages are important. A breakdown in this filter might lead to ""information overload"" - and contribute to the confusion often experienced by schizophrenics.

DUMP uses visual and auditiv technics to build up a situation like it can be provoked by such a brain disfuntion. The the text blocks used in the work are exlusively spam-mails, which in formal are rarely different from the speech of schizophasia. DUMP is a work about empty communication, about void signs, abstract language and incoherent speech, about information overload and repetition, about confused tattle, inapprehensible word salad, thoughts going nowhere, language going everywhere, splitter, fragments, a communication of refusal.

Simon,"Given:   A 32 X 32 Grid

Allowed: Any element of the grid 
         to be black or white

Shown:   Every Icon


Can a machine produce every possible image?
What are the limits of this kind of automation?
Is it possible to practice image making by exploring
all of image-space using a computer rather
than by recording from the world around us?
What does it mean that one may discover visual imagery
so detached from ""nature""?


Every Icon progresses by counting. Starting with an image
where every grid element is white, the software displays
combinations of black and white elements, proceeding toward
an image where every element is black. In contrast to presenting
a single image as an intentional sign, Every Icon presents all possibilities.


The grid contains all possible images. Any change in the starting
conditions, such as the size of the grid or the color of the element,
determines an entirely different set of possible images.
When Every Icon begins, the image changes rapidly. Yet the progression
of the elements across the grid seems to take longer and longer.
How long until recognizable images appear? Try several hundred trillion years.
The total number of black and white icons in a 32 X 32 grid is:
1.8 X 10308(a billion is 109).
Though, for example, at a rate of 100 icons per second (on a typical desktop computer),
it will take only 1.36 years to display all variations of the first line of the grid,
the second line takes an exponentially longer 5.85 billion years to complete.


While Every Icon is resolved conceptually, it is unresolvable in practice.
In some ways the theoretical possibilities outdistance
the time scales of both evolution and imagination.
It posits a representational system where computational
promise is intricately linked to extraordinary duration and momentary sensation. Through brute force, this piece calculates every possible combination of black and white dots on a 32 by 32 grid. Given enough time, the grid will show every icon possible--from your mouse pointer, to the Mona Lisa.

From a surface perspective, Every-thing.net appears to have a particular meaning or purpose. Like a mythology, the meaning becomes different when viewed from a deeper perspective. Every-thing.net can be viewed as a mythology, one which uses the great mythological actors of our time: numeric calculations. Within the mythology of Every-thing.net, the heroes are the mathematical calculations and the actions of these heroes produce the pages of scrolling numbers. The various facts, statistics and calculations within Every-thing.net act  as a facade for the potential of thought and physical matter, potentials which may be calculable using mathematics, but potentials which are so large that they become inconceivable.

by CAE on biotechnology. The audience takes genetic tests and gives cell samples for DNA analysis. When it comes to technology, the focus and the hype is on new information
and communication technologies. From a marketer's perspective, this only
makes sense, because these new technologies seem to offer the public a new
utopian frontier; however, those who work with new complex technology on an
everyday basis know that its primary function is to increase the velocity
of market place dynamics, which in turn increases the intensity of labor.
The organic systems--the humans--in the technocracy can no longer maintain
themselves at such speeds: physiological and psychological pathologies
abound in the new techno-environment. Unfortunately, it's too late to slow
the economic engines of technoculture, and so the problem of collapsing
organic platforms can only be solved by drastic flesh reconfigurations.


This new social tendency has arrived at the right time. One of the leading
eugenicists of the 1930s, Frederick Osborn, believed that in the future
eugenics would be a part of everyday life consciousness (as opposed to
being a policy imposed on populations). According to Osborn, in the time
that we now know as the period of the economy of desire/surplus and the
nuclear family, people would not only volunteer to engage in eugenics
practices, but would pay to do so. Because market competition would reach
such an intense state in late capital, and wealth and prestige would be the
only measure of quality of life in death-of-god society (death of the
nonrational), people would be forced by circumstance to acquire whatever
would help to make them more fit for success in the marketplace. That
future is now the present, and the first experiments in developing
voluntary eugenic consciousness and in developing eugenic practices are
underway in clinics for reproductive services. However, unlike its
technological sibling, telecommunications, reproductive technology remains
largely outside of everyday life. It's not something that we experience as
mundane technology (like the telephone or TV) nor as a potential social
problem (like industrial pollution); it is something we only hear about
after it has been filtered through the legitimating signs of science and
medicine. Consequently, the eugenic practices that occur on a daily basis
in the labs and the clinics have no reality for those outside certain
scientific and medical specializations. Such practices are silent
subversions of everyday life that will not reveal themselves until they are
fully deployed and the damage has already been done.


Some artists and activists (particularly in Europe) understand the nature
of this secret technological revolution, and have tried to inject critical
information into public discourse about this hidden development in an
attempt to raise critical awareness about unacceptable medical and
scientific practices; however, no political front or real public debate has
emerged that includes a radical perspective (such as there is in the
critique of information and communications technology). CAE suspects that
the continued lack of concern on the part of the public is partly because
the tactics used to increase public awareness are too tame for such a
well-guarded situation. While CAE does not think the older and proven
methods of representational resistance should be jettisoned, in regard to
reproductive technologies, more extreme experimentation is called for.

http://www.xs4all.nl/~mouche  ""Art history is replete with examples of artistic alter egos, from Marcel Duchamp's Rrose Selavy to Luther Blissett, a British soccer star whose name was assumed in the mid-1990s by numerous Net artists and activists when posting to email lists and online discussion forums. In 1996, a Web site that purports to be the work of an adolescent girl appeared at http://mouchette.org. Visitors to the site are greeted with a lurid close-up of a flower, its petals crawling with ants and flies, accompanied by a portrait of a sad-looking girl and the following text: 'My name is Mouchette/I live in Amsterdam/I am nearly 13 years old/I am an artist.' Some of the site's content has a deceptively innocent quality. For example, clicking on the word 'artist' on the home page leads to a page with the following text: 'An artist? Yes. Here is a tip: I heard that the only way to become an artist is to say you are one. And then you can call 'art' everything you make… Easy, he?' Other sections are more grotesque (images of raw meat) or sexually suggestive (a tongue licking the screen). Many pages feature interactive Web forms, including multiple-choice questions that trigger delayed reaction emails – days or weeks later, visitors receive unexpected, often flirtatious emails from Mouchette. There is also a listing of members of Mouchette's international fan club, which includes art institutions around the world."" (Tribe/Reena) -------- Original Message --------

A theme running through most of my theoretical and net.art work is the
relation between the body and technology.  Specifically, two questions
are of interest here: Firstly, how do normative, dominant notions of what a body
is get constructed in a given context?  And secondly, within those normative
models, where are the possible points of slippage, formlessness,
hybridity?  Recently, much of my attention has been focused on how the
body-technology relationship is articulated in the contemporary
lifesciences (molecular biotechnology, genomics, tissue engineering,
digital anatomy, tele-medicine, bioinformatics).  These fields provide
one example of a set of discourses and practices that are, as we speak,
in the process of articulating what will come to be recognized (and thus
legitimized) as body & technology, as nature & culture, and as
information & materiality.

Ballard's HIGH RISE. High : Rise was a project created for Robert
Ascher's Visual Anthropology class at Cornell
University during Spring 1998. The purpose of
the project was to profile a person, real or
fictional, through a visual medium. 

By choosing the World Wide Web as my
medium, the project's conceptual
framework parallels the philosophical
aspect of J. G. Ballard's 1975 novel,
High-Rise, from which this project was
loosely adapted from. 

Ballard's novel served not only as a
socio-cultural commentary on the state of
the human condition in an environment
accelerated by technology, but it was also
the starting point to which I began a
theoretical discourse on the ideology of
progress and what that meant for us as a
culture at the end of the twentieth century.

Technology has always been the emblem
of human advancement and civilization,
and throughout history, it has become the
signifier of progress, enlightenment, and
power for a nation or a group of people.

Ballard's novel fundamentally questions
this notion of forward movement by
suggesting that man lives in an illusion of
""civilization"" created by technology's
phantasmagoric appeal.

My project documents the protagonist's
experience in a high-rise building during
a period of about three months. The
trajectory of the narrative and concept of
the project is always upward. One is
forced to read upward and navigation is
entirely limited to the upward movement.
This forced habit is antithetical to our
natural visual orientation to read top-down
and the constant requirement to reorient
oneself when a new sentence flashes on
the screen simultaneously question both
the user's dependence on this kind of
technology for the unveiling of the
narrative and the protagonist's
transformation in relation to the building.

The layering of the text throughout the
narrative progression becomes chaotic
and disorderly - the threat of a text that is
unfamiliar, threatening, and resistant to
knowledge is also something I consider
as a pivoting point to not just the narrative
mapping of this project but also to the
web as a tool of text-based
communication. The text begins
singularly but becomes congested and
disorienting; knowledge becomes
multiplied and in a sense distracted by the
technology.

""I sometimes think that the people are good, and sometimes that they are bad.""

-Vuk Cosic, 8/23/99 ""A seminal figure in the history of New Media art, Slovenian artist Vuk Cosic is widely acknowledged as having coined the term ""net.art"" in 1995. As New Media artist Alexei Shulgin points out, Cosic's phrase is a Duchampian readymade: Cosic saw the words ""net"" and ""art"" conjoined by a dot in a jumbled email message and started using the term to describe Internet-based art.” (Tribe/Jana)

“Vuk Cosic, born in Belgrade in 1966, has shown consistent interest in historical narrative (he worked as an archaeologist before becoming an artist) and variable ways to make ideas material (such as teaching, art and writing), but it was the reduced amount of time between publication and feedback that eventually led him to create internet-based art. Cosic, who had taught archaeology and been active with cultural initiatives through the Soros Foundation in Slovenia and Serbia, also had experience as an activist: ‘My background includes several years in the ranks of what we called the Dissident movement. Most of my actions were part of the very general oppositional activism. Some of those were artistic, some journalistic and some were agitation. I felt very deeply an imperative to create a parallel system of values that would counter the dominant discourse in Yugoslavia. The language that I used at the time was thus heavy on “us” vs “them” both in social and artistic thinking. I believe that actually there is a bridge between that and what later became net.art.’"" (Greene) From Cezanne to Warhol, this ""history of art"" is redrawn according to the simple iconographic style of airports. But the history doesn't end with Warhol; a few contemporary net.art celebs are added for good measure.",8/19/01 21:46,http://www.ljudmila.org/~vuk/history/,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/1725/,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,,8/19/97 21:46,,,"History of Art for Airports, art world, design, Formalist, HTML, language, netart, postmodern, Visual"3224,hit me,Nicolas,Boulard,boulard nicolas,"click 'n read, have a nice trip",2/22/02 0:00,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/3224/hit_me/index.html,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/3224/hit_me/index.html,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,Date created: 2002-02-22,2/22/02 0:00,,,"Anti-art, Conceptual, france, HTML, indicible.fr.fm, interact, Javascript, language, let me tell you something, netart, Nicolas Boulard, Participatory, resistance, Strasbourg, tactical media, Text, Visual"1734,Homework,Alexei,Shulgin,Alexei Shulgin,"The Network Is the Artwork (TM)

(At least) two ""works"" in Beyond Interface--Homework and Desktopp IS--expand both the traditional notion of a collaboration--between and among artists, writers, designers, programmers--and what constitutes ""a work.""

Bookchin describes the genesis of Homework:
""It began as a homework assignment for a class i was teaching.
[Intro to Computing in the Arts. http://jupiter.ucsd.edu/~bookchin/syllabus.html]
Heath Bunting found the url from his server, because I had linked to a page
of his (he one you are including in your show).
he then posted my url on 7-11.

[a listserv http://www.vuk.org/7-11/]

you saw some of the mail that followed.

""Alexei asked me if some artists could  do the homework assignment for me, and they asked if i would grade it. I then received work from heath and vuk and alexei. I linked their projects to my homework page, posted grades and it continued from there.

[Final projects: http://jupiter.ucsd.edu/

~bookchin/finalProject.html]

Alexei then sent out a call for artists to do the homework to a number of

art lists, like rhizome, nettime, and some others.

[Attention uncertified [net][internet][web] artists!]

So the project emerged collaboratively from discussions that took place on

7-11 and with the artists mentioned above and then other artists, mostly

from the 7-11 mailing list, began submitting work.
""Authorship is complicated enough when it revolves around issues of the collaborative possibilities of the Net [Bookchin, Shulgin], the increasing commodification of language [Andujar, Bunting], or the authorship of ""derivative"" texts [e.g. through viewer interactions, Biggs]. 

""It becomes even more layered with issues of the authenticity/anonymity of remote communications [see Bookchin's 'Artist Statement,' which is authored by an anonymous source who purported to be critic Peter Weibel], as well as the conscious role playing that the Net engenders [note for example, that in Bookchin's Grade/Evaluation of Keiko Suzuki, she writes ""woman to woman"" but links to ""The Transvestite Page."" And in her Grade/Evaluation of Rachel Baker, she writes: 'You would *almost* think that Keiko's work was done from a male perspective...'].""

As much as Homework raises all these issues in exemplary ways, perhaps the most fascinating negotiation is how Bookchin manages to actually grade and evaluate a number of net.art projects. While on the surface, it is all in good fun, Bookchin not only does grade the work (A-F) but manages to get in some succinct lectures about the three C's of the computer, throw her art history weight around, anoint a couple of new sub-genres of net.art, skewer net demi gods, and generally hold the line against work that does not meet the assignment.

I am glad you're admitting the 7-11 submissions

your modesty is charming!

We did have some dialogue about it 

and yes, that is the whole idea, to feel better in this context than 

in, for instance, Kassel. Or at least, to express the authentic 
feeling that the two are equal.

The batches move seamlessly from one subject to the next based on similarities in form, composition, color, and theme.  This results visually in a colorful grid that slowly changes as the viewer scrolls through it.  Images of houses being demolished transition into images of buildings on fire, to forest fires, to billowing smoke, to geysers, to bursting fire hydrants, to fire hoses, to spools of thread.  The site is constantly updated week after week, batch by batch, sometimes in bursts, sometimes very slowly.

The blog came out of my natural tendency to spend long hours obsessing over Google Image searches, collecting photos I found beautiful and storing them by theme.  Often the images that interest me are of industrial or municipal materials or everyday photo snapshots.  I do not select images or videos that appear to be intentionally artistic.  Happily, the process of researching various themes in this way has lead to unintentionally learning about topics I might never have otherwise, including structural drying, bale feeders, B2P, VAWTs, screw turbines, the cleveland pack, and powder coating.

I feel that my experience wandering through Google Image Search and YouTube hunting for obscure information and encountering unexpected results is a very common one.  My blog serves as a visual representation of this phenomenon.  This ability to endlessly drift from one topic to the next is the inherently fascinating quality that makes the internet so amazing.

IHSE is a series of autonomous architectural buildings. Each photo shows a geometric figure, which overrides the forms of classical architecture. There is no roof nor a base, no top or bottom. The buildings float in the void. Architecture which looks like concrete capsules through which one can move into a different space-time continuum.

to anonymous and indistinct visual static. Using data encryption 
technology, the artist experiments with the structure of these images in 
a programmatic and transparent fashion.
 This Web site displays thumbnail-linked galleries of images collected 
from the Internet.  The pixel data in each image was encyphered using 
the strongest cryptographic algorithms, resulting in images that appear 
to be composed of random static.

Great care was taken to insure that the original images can not be 
recovered, especially through coercive methods.  The images were 
collected in a ""clean-room"" environment from various deeply linked 
locations using a Web browser with its URL display areas obscured from 
view and with image display support disabled.  An encrypted redirection 
service was also used to insure that no useful ISP or similar logs were 
recorded during collection.

Each image was selected based on its promotional context, encyphered 
using a unique properly randomly generated key, and compressed.  The 
keys existed only long enough to perform the encryption.  The images 
were compressed using a scheme that preserved the visual appearance of 
the ciphers.  The software used was improvisationally composed from code 
extracted from various open-source net repositories.

The encrypted and compressed images were transferred to the Web site, 
and finally the hard drive in the computer used for collection and 
processing was destroyed.  The artist never viewed the original images 
(in some cases images were made visible to the artist during collection 
due to the design characteristics of the associated Web sites, and these 
images were specifically rejected).

The aesthetic result of this work seems to a city-profile, a perspective landscape that mixes buildings with a fictitious escape point.

But behind the aesthetic result, the concept of this work, its heart, is the creation-process of every single shape (rectangle), provided by an algorithmic structure with random numbers generation.

Instance City doesn't define in its source-code fixed values for shapes, but only ranges of values combined with random numbers generated in-time when the browser executes the byte-code.

Thus, every city-profile is composed by a random number of rectangles, randomly sized and positioned (following some simple algorithmic rules) in order to obtain, most of the times, a meaningful result on the screen.

Instance City is part of a set of works (called ""Class/Instance"") based on the same idea: the artwork as a class, a flexible and perpetual generator of instances with the same meaningful aesthetic result.

In this case the generic class (defined in the algorithm) is every time instanced with random numbers to produce an (approximately) unique image on the screen.

To see more Instance City instances, please wait some seconds (8) for the automatic page refresh or refresh the page continuosly in your browser by yourself. After some refreshes you could appreciate the difference between images.

After that you could ask yourself: Do I like instances themselves or Do I like the class behind them?

two people who love and hate each other at the same time.

Our education has been to understand distances from the criteria of its physical limitations; subjective more then objective. Distances between places are mostly opportunistic visions of our reality; dividing more than unifing a people.

Instead, I prefer thinking that reality becomes a place without distances... a place where our body and mind can expand without limits or borders...

It was presented as part of PHOTOESPANA 2000. She produced this work with new media technologies.

The task of this web site is to insert (to open) an interactive strategy of participation and communication online. 

Send images and texts of relevant factories or industrial architecture which are condemned, in the process of being destroyed, or abandoned; these materials can be related to your own experience, or related to your neighborhood, family or anything else.

All participants will be included in this project and their contributions will be accessible from this web page.

The artist, one of Spain's pioneers in the field of new media art, shows the dimension of a process which began in Chicago, when she was finishing her studies in the department of New Technologies directed by Sonia Sheridan in the Art Institute, during the 70's. Gonzalez has since continued her work in the exploration of new and experimental technology, having presented her work in both solo and group exhibitions.

She is now interested in the notion of architecture, and themes related to space.

The concept behind this project is based on an existing factory, a historic building characteristic of the regional industrial revolution in which it's inserted, and which, when ending its century-long existence, has ultimately been deprived of its function, because its installations and machinery are now out of date. These dilapidated buildings and the vision of the interiors and exteriors in ruins are the focus of this project. The pictoral frame of the photographic eye and the video camera captures the building's fractionated destruction, the slow disappearance of time which impels us to address its outlying territory and the landscape on which it resides. As a result, this serves as a kind of industrial archeology brought about by the factory's own dislocation in time and space.

With the use of new media technologies, the artist emphasizes the process-like character of the presented work. The recycling continues to be a preliminary procedure which comes before any new configuration or intervention, contributing to the overall artistic unity of Gonzalez's project.

Mouse.Dance by Neil Zusman and Arthur Aviles

By Carl Goodman, ReelNYWeb

http://www.wnet.org/reelnewyorkweb/zusman/index.html


A series of captured gestures of dancer/actor Arthur Aviles and two narrative text fragments form the basis of the Mouse.Dance, an interactive ""tour de mouse"" that is surprisingly rich given that it takes place on an area of the screen roughly the size of a Kleenex. It is also an example of
an emerging trend towards short, though high-impact, online experiences that are well suited to the surfing habits of time-stressed, easily distracted Internet audiences. 

The first and fourth ""movements"" of Mouse.Dance gain expressive power from creative deployment of the cursor AND alphanumeric keyboard, as well as from the scaling of 2D images and their movement to present the illusion of activity in three-dimensions. These techniques, common in CD-ROM-based art, play, and game experiences, are now being rediscovered online. 

The maker and presenter's attempts to characterize the work as ""Internet cinema,"" or in terms of music or dance or poetry, or Genet's theater for the dead, for that matter, only serve to illustrate the function of the Internet as an arts discipline super-collider. What do you call something that involves using a dancer as a paintbrush? 

No matter. However it is described, Mouse.Dance delivers an evocative, media-rich experience from someone clearly in command of the variables of this emerging (multi)medium.

                       MULTIPLE DWELLING is an installation project which will
                       exist simultaneously in a real, physically-constructed space and
                       an artificial, digitally-generated one. It is a techno-poetic
                       response to the theories of Antonin Artaud, Delueze/Guattari
                       and The Critical Art Ensemble on the concept of a ""Body
                       without Organs."" 

                       The installation project is instigated by a scene from the movie
                       ""Coma,"" in which a room full of bodies, involuntary donors of
                       their own organs, float, suspended in a state of perpetual coma.
                       In Multiple Dwelling, these suspended bodies, once comatose,
                       will be shocked to their senses through an overload of
                       audio-visual ephemera and complete technical breakdown.

                       The physical installation will be constructed of
                       industrial-minimalist structures, platforms for observation,
                       scanning and accumulation of bio-data, computers and
                       associated input and output devices. Software programs for the

This installation used sound, text and reactive co-composition to create a unique ""place"" that allowed virtual and actual spaces to interpenetrate.

During the installation, 10 musicians were placed throughout the gallery. Each musician was given a sheet of 24 leitmotivs. Each leitmotiv was designated to be played in response to a specific action of the proximate or remote participants. Remote participants could hear the sounds of the space, and could choose the point within the space where they wanted to place themselves.  Both remote and proximate participants were encouraged to engage in a synchronous on-line chat with other participants. Proximate participants were free to move around, speak, dance, or otherwise become involved in the activities. Chat dialog and movements triggered the response of the musicians, and determined the outcome of the work.

This documentary site simulates what a remote participant would have heard during the event.

The language of science is mathematics and has become inaccessible to most. We live in interesting times in which much of the most advanced and imaginative thought about our universe...about the very space and time dimensions...indeed about the very notion of dimension itself...is dangled in front of us as metaphor, but ultimately invisible to all but a few well versed in the language of mathematics.

If language is the embodiment, the mirror, of who we are as sentient beings, then we need a language which bridges our divides (be it right brain-left brain, east or west) and brings together our innate sensibilities of the visual-physical, musical-mathematical and verbal-text based sensibilities.

Such language will require a maximum simplification, a further distillation of universally accepted ideas of simple colored geometry combined with elementary notions of mathematics to break us through the hour-glass bottleneck...expanding out to realize the full richness of this other side. And this new language is accessible to all. Once past the initial pain, the simplicity and joy of relating the simple dimensions of a colored square to the multi-dimensions of a rich aggregate of multi-colored rectangles will amaze the child in you. Realizing that this new visual language is an accessible, working, hands-on metaphor for the entire universe will amaze

In that time I have explored a wide range of conceptual issues. My rationale for these investigations has been firmly fixed on examining aspects of ‘the digital’ as a discrete domain. However, my most recent work Nebula has forced me to think again. The works themselves are the outcome of the implementation of comparatively simple AI as applied to individual pixels. Simple parameters operating in a supportive architecture create amazing complexity, gas clouds of remarkable depth and beauty. 

It is important to state that I do not see my work as emulating real nebulae. One has only to look upon a picture of the Crab Nebula to see that the real thing has a wonder of its own.  My interest here is in the way that my renditions inter-relate conceptually with the real thing given that the former are based on such simple parameters. Both phenomena present themselves to us as 2-dimensional yet both have great depth. Time is a particular component of that depth. Some of my versions of Nebula can take well over eight hours to form. I have couched Nebula as a critique of the ‘skip intro’, ‘all content now’ imperative of ‘the digital’. In Nebula I am encouraging an attitude of dwelling with a digital artwork through some form of ‘astronomical time’.",11/16/04 0:00,http://www.user-production.co.uk/nebula/nebula_001.html,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/30393/nebula_001.html,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: generative

The work is an audiovisual, digital, crime-detective story in the full length of a feature film. The three chapters of north tell a story of a woman called Ly who is commissioned to shadow a man. 

Her search for clues is recorded in text, audio and image. Folllowing the three different chapters of the online fiction, the story breaks apart in chapter two and gets fully out of control in chapter three.

more info on: http://www.ref17.net/hunziker/nord.html PART 1: It starts with a man's voice telling us that drivers travelling north are four times more likely to be involved in a crash than those heading south. The screen is split in four small windows. Per mouseclick on an image or an underlined text the content of one or several windows changes. The story of Ly and how she is looking for the wanted man, named T, is told in a associative, fragmentary way. Ly travels around by car, takes photographs, records voices, shoots films, writes her reports, but she fails over and over again to find some evidence for the existence of T. 

PART 2: Ly decides to start again from the beginning, this time with herself as the subject of her investigation. 'T' is not mentioned anymore. The story falls apart. Each of the four windows follows its own action; fragments, particles of the story. The central motifs in the second chapter are Ly's self reflection, references to her identity and her language. 

PART 3: The story gets out of control. The story breaks away. There is no story. The user can't interact no more. He watches how windows layer one above the other, disappearing and showing up again. Known elements from part one and part two appear again, new ones arrive, until at the end everything empties and you find yourself again at the start page where everything began.

We are involved only in the area of movement which produces sensation."" His photodynamism recorded images in a distorted state, ""since images themselves are inevitably transformed in movement"".

Patinage as a form of 'videodynamism' is not concerned with perfect reproductions, nor the moment: ""our aim is to make a determined move away from reality, since cinematography, photography and chronophotography already exist to deal with mechanically precise and cold reproduction."" We see the ice skaters devolve into broken idealised forms, and without user interaction, they eventually fade away completely.

The intention is to capture something more essential, to represent the motion itself, its form in space across time: ""We seek the interior essence of things: pure movement; and we prefer to see everything in motion"".

Videodynamism takes account of both the motion of the subject and the motion of the screen upon which the subject is depicted.

Tap into a broad color palette, drift through your moods. Lazy and soothing. I've always been attracted to the mundane details of the ordinary world, the overlooked beauty of the surfaces, textures and colors of the environment that we live in.  Billboards, old advertisements painted on walls, sidewalks spotted with discarded bubblegum, rusted metal doors, crushed coffee cups - they all contain a story about the human life that created them.

When I painted, I treated paint like a found object.  I let the material show. I let its character direct the painting.  In my art made for the web, I look for the character in the medium itself.  What is the web, and what isn't it?  I make art from the mundane realities of the web: the browser, the buttons, the text, other people's web pages, Spam, discarded e-mail.  Not even found objects, these are the 'unfound' objects too trivial to be noticed in all the noise of this growing medium.

In my work I use the web as raw material.  I create art from the software that is readily available to anyone with access to this medium. I make the art low bandwidth and simple in design so that it can be accessed by a broad audience.  The artwork is at once fragile and fleeting.  It evolves over time and changes based on the actions of the visitor.  A design may dissappear in moments, and perhaps can never be reproduced exactly.  Yet it is by the same token very durable because it can immediately regenerate itself.

Ultimately what I'm exploring is not the technology, but the human life that inhabits it, creates it, re-creates it, and consumes it.  My artwork is an exploration of the human nature of the web.

A set of “programmed paintings” where a vocabulary of elaborate plastic forms is animated through an open set of programming rules. This “transformation grammar” allows for a deliberate part of accidents, while taking inspiration from modern scientific models (auto-organizational systems).

Each tableau programmé is interactive and reacts to the viewer’s movements. Motion capture is deeply imbedded within the work’s rules and conception.

Furthermore, all paintings are both global and local, always linked through the Internet and communicating with each other all around the world. This means  the attitude of a single viewer has direct repercussions upon what she, or all other viewers of other works, are seeing and experiencing at the same time.

Tableaux programmés is a testimony to the individual/collective dialectics of natural forces, to the increasingly global perspective Science is casting upon our world — and to the necessary bond which must perdure between Art and Science.
a turn in science
Our understanding of the world is being transformed everyday through radical innovations in dynamical analysis, new ways of observing and thinking biological or physical phenomenons. Such advances appear spectacular in every sense — as if science was now taking for itself the old Aristotelian motto: “Ars imitatur naturam” (art must imitate Nature).

In the current state of our scientific knowledge, complex interactions within the biosphere, auto-organization effects in nano-biological or nano-chimical structures — these are perceived and represented by increasingly spectacular models. Initiatives such as S. Wolfram’s cellular automata or Virgo Team’s “Millenium Run” universe simulation program might well be heralding the dawn of a Simulation Era.

While Science seems about to produce “works of the esthetic simulation of reality'' — as Artaud once wrote — art, having taken long ago distances with its mimetic fundations, could ignore what is coming and be left apart. My belief is that in the light of such revolutions of our representations, we artists shouldn’t leave Science alone to think Nature.

a question for arts
Arts and Science do entertain a fecund dialogue. Artists have always fed on scientific advances, using every tool available and creating by oppositions —  rationale/irrationalism, causality/randomness, truth/beauty… Scientists, for their part, have always sought in Arts the new semantic or plastic tools they required to convey revolutionary representations of the world. As a small example of this, the name “quark” (a subatomic particle) is taken from James Joyce.

So from the very first representations of a thee-dimensional space, in Renaissance Annunciations, from the Euclidean principles of “incommensurable measure” applied to classical perspective — to the genetic manipulations of Steeve Curtz’ Critical Art Ensemble, or the work of other current artists who use the living as a raw material, not mentioning Beuys, who questioned deeply the developments of technoscience — artists and scientists have always ventured in contiguous territories.

what it’s about
This common field of exploration/creation is what my tableaux programmés (programmed paintings) are about. Starting with the tools and materials available to the painter, they transform them through an algorithmic manipulation where the computer code acts as a new kind of paint medium.

It all starts with drawing on the pen tablet. Thoughts, unorganized and plastic, are recorded in sequences. This is an essential step for me — my base material has to be informed in a plastic sense. 

This base vocabulary is then animated through an open frame of programming, a visual grammar allowing for many different outcomes while eliminating irrelevant transformations. This is where auto-organization comes into play. The forms’ structure and arrangements within the space of the picture are governed by a complex set of rules, relying upon the expressivity of programming. It’s a complex, autopoietic system, self-organizing, whose inner workings take from scientific modelizations, both in cellular/molecular dynamics and in celestial mechanics.

Programming of course allows for a controlled measure of accidents: unexpected occurrences might always question the work’s logic and stability, claiming space for a zone of uncertainty where open proposals can appear.

entropy / communication
Lastly, these works react to movement. Each tableau programmé has a sensor capable of interpreting its viewer’s motions. It may react to it directly, but it also relays this information to the global network these paintings — permanently linked to each other through the Internet — provide. 

Actually, what each viewer is seeing (forms and transformations) depends in part from her own motions — and in part from the motions of all viewers in the world, at that same time. In this way, all viewers are linked through the paintings.

Motion capture inserts a entropy factor, both local and global, which deeply affects the behavior of each work. The tableaux programmés are conceived from the start to allow for such interactions. Each picture dissolves and is regenerated by a constant relation between the software and whatever “share of reality” the system is able to capture. So the picture keeps conversing it with an external force — the network’s global “intelligence” —, which may reshape at any moment its plastic vocabulary and grammar.
I see it as a good illustration of what repercussions our individual and collective behaviors do find upon the balance of our ecosystems. In this way, the tableaux programmés initiative can be seen as an ecological manifestation.

technical stuff — in brief
Each programmed painting is provided on a specialized display unit framed like a painting. Within its frame, it includes a LCD graphic display (1024x768), processor, internal battery with reasonable autonomy, Wi-Fi access, internal web cam for motion sensing, facilities for set-up and maintenance.

The unit runs a specialized software, with open-source code, in kiosk mode. It cannot be used for other purposes than displaying the programmed paintings. It communicates through the Internet with a protected Web server where graphic designs, programming, and any rules of actualizations are stored.

These units are thought as integrant part of the work. They will be made in a limited number, and will provide ultimately the only way of access to the whole series’ dynamic paintings. The artist is committed to maintenance of his works/units.

Refresh examines the obsession with webcams via a combination of real and fabricated ""live"" scenarios. Introduction to Diller & Scofidio's Refresh

Architects Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio have worked in many media using the built environment and the visual arts to reveal societal norms that operate invisibly to govern and inform daily relationships. One recent area of this investigation has focused on ""liveness"" -- a term that originated in broadcasting and has grown to be synonymous with authenticity and a trusted reality. 

For their first project for the web, entitled Refresh, Diller + Scofidio have taken office webcams as their point of departure, with the intention of examining the role of live video technologies on everyday life. A webcam is a camera that takes pictures at set intervals, that can range from 15 times per second to once per hour, then instantly transmits the images to a web server, where the image becomes simultaneously available to anyone on the web. At present, thousands of webcams exist, broadcasting live pictures of fish tanks, traffic conditions, vending machines, private bedrooms, offices... 

The artists speculated on the motivations for these cameras: ""The live cam phenomenon can be thought of as a public service, or a mode of passive advertisement, or it may be a new type of exhibitionism, or self-disciplinary device. The desire to connect to others in real time may be driven by a response to the ""loss"" of the public realm. But, however varied the motives, live cam views always seem casual and lacking dramatic interest and content; they appear unmediated. Despite this apparent innocence, cameras are willfully positioned, their field of vision is carefully considered, and behavior within that field cannot help but anticipate the looming presence of the global viewer."" 

For each of the dozen sites located in the US, Europe and Australia that Diller + Scofidio selected for this project, they have constructed fictional narratives using text and fabricated images. For every site there is a grid of twelve images, one of which is live and refreshes when clicked; the other eleven have been constructed for this project with the aid of hired actors and Photoshop. None of the people from the actual location appear in the fabricated images; however, the juxtaposition of the live and the fictional establishes a provocative correspondence. The stories, which range in time from a single day to several seasons, concentrate on subtle changes in behavior as a consequence of the acknowledged presence of the camera in the office: a gradual shift in dress style, the activities of an after-hours cleaning crew, a ritual of stacking paper, one person's discreet and incessant ordering of take out food, and a potential office romance unfolding by the water cooler. There is nothing shocking or dramatic, rather, everyday conventions are slightly modified, either to perform for or to hide from the camera. 

The flip side to the performative role chosen or imposed on the people at the live site is the role of the spectator at the other end. Diller + Scofidio argue that liveness appeals to both ends of the technophile/technophobe spectrum: ""For technophobes who blame technology for the collapse of the public sphere, liveness may be a last vestige of authenticity -- seeing and/or hearing the event at the precise moment of its occurrence. The un-mediated is the im-mediate.

It was inspired by the Beaufort Scale which measures wind speed. This work was produced specifically for Variablemedia, a London (UK) based organisation which initiaties time/process based web projects involving internationally based artists. SeaPoint began on June 8, 2002 at the variablemedia.org site. With updates occurring daily, SeaPoint ran for a period of 28 days. 

During each day of the project Harmey recorded a 10 second digital video sample of the Irish Sea from a fixed location on shore at Seapoint on the south Dublin coast. She  processed the day's recorded images into a video animation file and allocated this file a number and description from the Beaufort Scale. The Beaufort Scale (for use at sea) measures wind speed by observing the visual effects of wind on water and allocates a number ranging from 0 for calm conditions to 12 for a hurricane. This measurement for the day's images, combined with various chance procedures, was applied to the concurrent audio recording in a resampling process devised by McNulty. These audio files were then recombined with the video animation as a short Flash film.

The Beaufort Scale (for use at sea) is an adaptation of an original scale devised in 1806 by Irish born Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort. The visual descriptions of the water, used by this adaptation, are highly poetic e.g. #1 Scale-like ripples, #2 Small, short wavelets with glassy crests.

subjectivity.

The alienation experienced when the subject comes into direct contact with
the screen, the interface, and the code is the affect of the displaced
embodiment which resonates within the symbolic realm of cyberspace.

While the corporeal body disappears, it is replaced by an immaterial
outline of our passing presence. The code, then, refers to the body's DNA
structure: what becomes visible to the eye is that which is generally
hidden.

As we shift toward a state of immaterial existence, technology increasingly
eliminates all traces of material reality. Moving beyond the threshold which divides the space between the real and the imaginary--the physical and the virtual.

by: David Colagiovanni.  

Dick Higgins was an early proponent and user of computers, as a tool for art making, dating back to the mid 1960s.  Higgins coined the term intermedia to describe his activities and those of other artist of his time.  He was a poet, artist, performer, scholar and publisher.  His most notable series of work is his Danger Music scores.  This project is based on Higgins' performance score:
Danger Music Number Seventeen  which reads:
Scream! Scream! Scream! Scream! Scream! Scream!

In this project non-performers (a gallery owner, a journalist, a welder, photographer, retail store manager,and others) were asked to scream until they couldn't scream anymore.  The resulting videos are shown on multiple screens (one per person).

The work depicts machines that are defunct, have crashed, have viruses or have been destroyed by human intervention. Computers show blank screens or error codes becoming victims of information overload. CCTV cameras that are obsolete in their design. Circuit boards that are so badly wired they could not possibly work are placed alongside motherboards that are crudely smashed.

1. TRONS. Yoke and Zooms TRONS are deconstructed circuit boards that are reformatted into basic figures then are sewn onto a fushia pink canvas, The feminine nature of the colour pink is to contrast with the masculine nature of circuitry.

Moving elements, re-assembling stories, order memories, perpetuating attachments, arranging affinities, divert bodies, from one another, re-routing values, structuring small arrangements, displaying dissimilarities, tune -up violins, orchestrate daily calendars, shuffling evidence, classifying classes, scrutinizing representations, interfering pains, weaving angers, securing fears, syndicate kisses, smile to correlations, reconstruct families, prioritize bounds, assign legends, dissect rituals, such is the task of the iconopathe who will gradually ""pict"" and depict series of altarpieces organized according to 37 categories established by The Family of Man.

 This project was created by Isabelle Massu during a residency at Kawenga Territoires numériques, Montpellier, France. 
Development : Timothée Rolin The great family of Man
1950's: first constitutions of family albums, pictures are multiplied, relocated, traded like cards. Tools are democratized, one does not go on holiday without his Kodak, documenting his small world, while other more professionals handle the big one, observe, collect and give away the far away exotic. Photographic exhibitions are increasing, showing it all, the private and the precious as well, humanist photographers set the tone and say the world in picture. In 1955 the Family of Man exhibition organized by the Museum of Modern Art in New York paints a portrait of humanity implying we all belong together. The exhibition is organized around 37 themes: love, birth, work, family, education, children, war and peace ... This is to show the universality of the human experience, but also the tremendous capacity photographs held in portraying this experience. Today the family has undoubtedly expanded, but  also appropriate tools of representation. Our daily pain is immortalized on  internet. The distant cousin take charge of the Really Simple Syndication, the dangerous liaisons. In turn, other family members implement, participate, collaborate to weave the web and feel unstoppable in their illusionnary function, to create meaning. Not too isolated from each other, not too close either, we like to be part of that family.  We enjoy it, cherish it in search of similarities within this impalpable tribe. Exchanging gift without remorse from screen savior to instant postcard, a difficult choice among 106,118, 222,767 sunsets,160,669 horses and 239,879 births.

One of the most popular family is Google's, it's family album is named after Picasso and casa, Picasa. Father creator aspires to housing rights and provides free hosting to all homeless families. He established a  solidarity economy throughout  a system of exchange and sharing within the ""community"". Everyone is free to access their neighbor's life, so much  to encourages sharing practices but prohibiting reproduction. Everyone has the right to speak, denounce if necessary, a real democratic space. A cyclopean inventory which takes literally from Family of Man. Marriages and births remain the engine of all sorts of gratitude. Daily routine is naked, privacy has red eyes, ""My Dog"", ""My Kitchen"", ""My wife"".

The Last Man Standing is a web site story _ part of reVoltaire archive / net.art_kit

Abstract: Tim Hallwood, spokesman for the Catholic Press Office, declared that, finally, the net will have a patron. cybernauts will be able to invoke the protection of Saint Isidore of Seville, the author of the first database. dissatisfied, the characters of the reVoltaire archive propose unanimously the candidature of Isidore Isou, the Pope of Lettrism. author of movie pictures of variable length, and of exhaustive philosophical treaties, printed in three copies [one for the French Academy, one for his friends, and one for himself]. Isidore of Seville and Isidore Isou are measuring, man to man, their forces, in single-handed combat, in the cyberspace: Netscape Communicator vs. Internet Explorer. In the end there will be only one.

""Designing an interface in which the two major browsers Netscape and Explorer are set up in a face to face combat in cyberspace, Calin Man shows the role and the place of net.art as a particular kind of mediator in the world of the Internet. Actually, the artist creates a space for net.art by doing the impossible, merging the two competitors and placing them next to each other. In ""The Last Man Standing,"" net.art is bravely viewed not as a buffer or judge between the two but rather as a redeemer of the Internet space and a shamanic mediator sanctifying cyber territories. Part of The Golden Virus and Other Web Site Stories project, which was presented in the exhibition Through the Looking Glass curated by Patrick Lichty and at the FCCM 2000, The Last Man Standing also won the second price at INFOS 2000 (off-line) net.art contest in Ljubljana. 

""Derived from filmic tradition in its framing and imagery, as well as in its use of narrative, The Last Man Standing is endowed with an iconographic semblance to Olia Lialina's net stories / net films such as ""My Boyfriend Came Back from War"" and Lev Manovich's ""Little Movies Vol.1."" The style of the project is based on film montage theory, while bordering on the idea of a classical net.art beauty, that is authenticity. 
While split in two, the frame within a frame in this work puts together two separate and irreconcilable units referring to the no mercy battle waged between Netscape and Microsoft. Framing each other and yet framed by the artists, divided and united at the same time in their new dwelling, these giants of the pixelized world are dwarfed within the frame and turned into two fictional characters in a baseball-bat duel.

Why poetry as virtual worlds? Throughout the years, I came to see 3d creation and poetry are not that far apart. For what is poetry if not an architecture of memory? What is poetry if not an architecture of sounds and images? What is poetry if not a world whose texture is the intertwining of emotions within the senses? What is poetry if not a space that the reader must sow with his own emotions? A poem is a world unto itself, one of almost unlimited scope (when the poem is successful). When one reads a poem, one goes through spaces of emotions. In fact, a successful poem is a virtual world in which one navigates. Poetry and the virtual are much closer than we think.

And so my 3d creations are architectures of memory, a nave to be filled with the user’s emotional texture. As is the case in a cathedral, I want these quiet spaces to trigger the release of emotions within the user, ultimately, if successful, drawn him into his own thoughts. I want my spaces to allow for a dialogue between the virtual architecture and the user’s emotion. I aim for my spaces to penetrate the user’s memory and compel him into texturing the surrounding virtual space with his emotions. I aim to create an architecture that is both physical and poetic, both virtual and literary, both present in space and shaped by the mind.

My strategies utilize anthropological and archaeological methodology, appropriate common research modalities and present visual archives to selectively insert particular and eccentric information into a dialogue based on the discrepancies between truth and myth concerning our past and present.

The Samuel Gray Society Project consists of the creation of an educational foundation whose mission is to preserve the people and culture of 18th century Colonial America through the life and legacy of Samuel Gray, the first man killed in the Boston Massacre.  Currently, I am the founder, president and sole member of this organization.

Almost nothing is known about the life of Samuel Gray, and as his self-appointed biographer, I intend to insert my narrative where none currently exists.  In this way, his story is mine to fabricate--a ripe mixture of historical fact and tenuous hypothesis, which, in many ways, is an honest depiction of the process of historical interpretation. 

This project involves two significant undertakings.  The first, following the creation of the Sam Gray Society website, includes an ongoing commitment to the collection and publication of data and scholarship regarding relevant aspects of American history.  The second is the continued management and expansion of artifacts housed in the SGS visual archives.  

The website is presented in an academic, encyclopedic, yet subversive manner that supports thoughtful questions regarding contemporary cultural or historical analysis, while critiquing unexamined signifiers of faction and sloganeering disguised as legitimate information.

If the phenomenon of serial killing itself is not new, then certainly our awareness of its existence is.  In fact, serial killers have become one of the major determining factors of the 20th century, and it appears that they continue to be so in the 21st century.  

'Trapped' is largely based on direct quotations from serial killers. Our dismay and fascination towards the enigma and complexity of the human psyche that creates this phenomenon is what holds this site together.

The site is composed of my own image materials and sampled materials from other sites on the Internet.

One character is represented by a silhouette of a male figure, the other one by a silhouette of a female figure.  There is no story in a traditional sense. Extremely strict and ritualized movements are executed by the two characters or multiple instances of the characters. The computer program serves as an invisible regisseur that directs the virtual actors by controlled random functions.

Audio and visual material are reduced to essential elements. Three different tones on both audio channels and simple rhythm patterns direct the sensation to the spatial movement of sound. The images are in black and white with a few accents in color to emphasize the aesthetic of the actors' ornamental geometry. On one hand, the silhouettes of the figures are treated as individual actors and on the other hand, the spatial arrangements and movements of groups of figures are used as ornaments. 

The same elements of the Minimal Opera are repeated in different variations. The result is a digital mantra open to various interpretations by the viewer. 

The first act's title is ""you me."" It concentrates on the two solo actors. The second part, named ""and,"" shows mass scenes and movements. The individual characters dissolve into ornamental patterns. ""you me and,"" the last part, mixes individual and group actions from the first two acts into a final scene. 

During the three sections the words ""you,"" ""me,"" and ""and"" appear as single words to provide poetic metaphors for the virtual narrative in the specific act. The positions of the actors in mass scenes are marked by numbers from 1 to 10. The numbers appear and disappear as the figures emerge on stage. 

Each act is a single scene, arising in a different browser window. If all three windows are open, the visual-acoustic story of all three acts is permanently present. This leads to various unpredictable mixtures and interpretations depending on the user's action of resizing, moving, and arranging of windows. In addition to this simple customization of the play, each act itself allows users to direct actors by changing the position of the mouse. 

With this combination of high-level (moving windows, etc.) and low-level interaction (inside a window) the user is enabled to fine tune the Minimal Opera. 

Interactivity is provided as a choice, not as a must. The viewer can influence the narrative but this active experience is not necessary to go through the piece - activity and passivity coexist simultaneously.

The full text of the PhD thesis is available on the site. Theory and Practice of Handmade Distributed Representation was a practice-led study of creativity and commitment. Its main outcomes include: (1) Aesthetic Selection of Pictures as Naked Genes algorithm, (2) its implementation as ASNakedGene computer application, (3) ‘picture populations’ generated using this software, and (4) volatile public static, an HTML/JavaScript ‘image population browser’.

The thesis also attempts a detailed account of the motivation for the development of ASNakedGene: to find a way of addressing experimentally one of the most urgent, yet oldest, concerns in art practice, known in the folklore (e.g.) as the distinction between being ‘in control’ and ‘letting go’, but also variously scrutinised via the related distinctions between: intent and intentional arc (Merleau-Ponty), sacrificial and transcendental blindness (Derrida), form and formless (Krauss), centripetal and centrifugal forces (Bakhtin), the differentiated and the undifferentiated (Ehrenzweig), attenuation and repleteness (Goodman), pragmatic/rhetoric and epistemic investments (cf. Kirsh and Maglio), representation and distributed representation (in connectionism), etc. In hope of unifying these perspectives (and following Dennett’s elaboration of Simon and Valéry), the problem of the articulated generator is identified as central to the study of creativity. Furthermore, the most concrete expression of the articulated generator was found in the problem of genetic representation in (creative) evolutionary systems, and specifically in evolution by “aesthetic selection” (Dawkins). In an effort to establish a germane evaluative framework, the concept of lossy incompressibility is introduced as the relevant notion of complexity (in contrast to Kolmogorov complexity, which equates it with randomness, i.e. lossless incompressibility).

ASNakedGene itself was a novel implementation of evolution by aesthetic selection of images where (1) there is no genotype to phenotype mapping, no germ-line/somatic-line distinction, no genetic representation, and where (2) evolutionary runs can be seeded by arbitrary sets of digital images. Art practice may one day emerge from the alchemist paradigm into the ""scientific method"" without losing any of its artiness, but gaining instead the freedom from its capitalised shamanism.",2/4/04 0:00,http://milos-and-slavica.net/volatile/public/static/index.html,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"

Voxels is an web-based interactive VRML work  that utilizes and 
incorporates spatialized 3d sound with vector 3d-graphics to communicate 
a simple aesthetic environment . Conceptually it is a plaything, by 
manipulating the ""boxes"" or ""voxels"" the user turns off and on 3d sounds  
and as such creates their own sound environment. The sound levels of 
this  virtual world are altered by the user via the many permutations 
and combinations of  audio loops that are attached to the faces of the 
cubes. This environment then invades the users' real world via their 
computer audio output and thusly extends the virtual world into the real 
and allows for an immersive experience. 

To further push the experiential nature of this piece the  user is also 
able to manipulate their sound environment by moving their own virtual 
point-of-view. By navigating the virtual space the user can create other 
levels of aural experiences based on position as well as simple on/off 
manipulation. This gives them a sense of self and a direct feedback loop 
to their real-world experience as they hear the sounds change as they 
move.

The stark aesthetic is deliberate in attempting to impede interference 
from visual cues and  does not attempt to pre-program the users level of 
interaction. It has a simplicity in its interface that crosses technical 
and computer-phobic boundaries creating  an interface that is easily

Brandon was raped and murdered in 1993 by two local men who discovered that ""he"" was a ""she.""

Brandon (the project) will explore a range of spaces, from online multiple user spaces (like chatrooms or avatars) to offline spaces like the Theatre Anatromicum, a Dutch new media performance venue once used for experimental surgeries on prisoners. 

Brandon also has a certain symbolic importance: as the first Web site to be commissioned by the Guggenheim Museum, its production might signal a new point in the trajectory of internet art--internet art has reached a stage when museums and established art spaces and sponsors are interested in enough to invest time and resources. 

This first installation of Brandon shows morphing gender signifiers, images of artifical and transformed physicality, and suggests a sense of impending violence and trouble.

Users drift along macro views of cracked roads and grassy berms, stitching their own narratives and non-places together based on the fluctuating juxtapositions of image and sound. The well known dérive from the Situationist International was an an intentional drifting, a conscious series of accidents and chance encounters designed to upset the efficient journey, the well-trod A to B of work to home, home to study, study to work. But while de-facto leader Guy Debord compared this technique to the abstract terrain of language used by the psychoanalyst, it’s practitioners played out their ‘detournments’ in a decidedly physical landscape of bricks-and-mortar architecture, crowds and passers-by. In contrast, Lee lets us drift through an entirely constructed digital topography, environments sourced from fact and stitched into fiction. Road indicators bleed into dusty rocks, a backyard hose snakes into beach dunes flecked with light. Stripped of social and built architecture, the cues are removed from this strange world. Without the functionality of banks and gas stations, without the community of companions, we’re left instead to wander in a non-place. The user becomes a hyohakusha, ‘one who moves without direction’.

In his study Paris et l’agglomération parisienne (Bibliothèque de Sociologie Contemporaine, P.U.F., 1952) Chombart de Lauwe notes that “an urban neighborhood is determined not only by geographical and economic factors, but also by the image that its inhabitants and those of other neighborhoods have of it.”

Along with photography, Lee employs field recordings, sound sourced from environments, as a type of second landscape. This supplementary topography ebbs and shifts to it’s own rhythm, introducing buzzing planes and pattering rainfall in cycles seemingly independent of the imagery. While air drifts through these sonic spaces, carrying noises from afar, the pictured environment is flattened, hermetically sealed in the thin glass layer of the user’s screen. The result is a type of quiet, slow-motion struggle, as imagery and acoustic information drift in and out, tugging against each other, leaving the viewer to resolve them into a coherent psycho-geographic “place” or simply hold them apart in constant tension.

A weathered skeleton
in windy fields of memory,
piercing like a knife
-Matsuo Basho

“Maze-like” is how the artist describes this space. Each user is restricted to a horizontal or vertical panning motion, butting up against the browser container before panning through another sliver of this constructed landscape. Whether ‘corrupting’ satellite images with spliced in photographs, or forcing us into claustrophobic movement, the work seems to question our relationship with technology, the authenticity of our knowledge, the self-limited ‘mapping’ of ourselves and our environment. How do we challenge pre-established notions or create true alternatives? Is it actually possible to ‘conceive what is outside’? Like the meditating prisoner who finds (some) freedom, rejecting the given maze parameters of this work to instead backtrack, linger, or restart reveals new possibilities and wider imagined ‘places’. Perhaps it’s this mode which allows a static wandering, a stationary drift in a ‘turbulent, stormy zone, where singular points and relationships of force between those points are tossed about”.",6/2/11 11:52,http://www.screens.org.nz/jae-hoon-lee-wanderer/,outside_link,,archive_URL,arr,"

Web Performer mounts an assault on your desktop by
spawning yapping, jumping miniature browser windows.
The work examines the nature of performance and identity
online, though it is experientially similar to the effect of
emptying a jar of frogs onto a table. 

For the performers in Web Performer, Endlicher chose to
work with characters -- historical, fictional, and in-between
(actors) -- that she herself has played in previous works or
performances. The initial image loops are of the artist
dressed as those characters. From there, she uses a novel
organizing principle: As you advance through the piece, the
picture used to represent each chosen character is itself
based on its corresponding Web page's ranking in a search
engine (such as Yahoo) for that character. Got it? As the
piece reaches its 6th and final level of character
transformation, a patient online art patron may be faced with
this burning question: ""WHAT THE HELL IS THE KEYBOARD

It is this simplicity that we hope will make it easy to access, easy to re-generate, easy to re-configure as a means of intellectually, conceptually, and creatively engaging our uses of everyday media, from The Old Gray Lady to Facebook and on down the line.

The early stages of the YTSSP had Red76  commissioning writers, educators, and artists to consider an idea they would like to explore further and then, rather than write in essay utilizing text, go onto YouTube and compile a playlist that could expand upon their concerns. In addition, each participant recorded a video forward to their composition.

We held screenings in abandoned storefronts, museums, universities, small art spaces, and even a movie theatre in Vancouver, Canada.

Through contributions from the likes of Robby Herbst, Gabriel Mindel Soloman, Courtney Dailey, Dan S. Wang, Mike Wolf, Juana Berrio, Stephen Duncombe, Ola Stahl, Sam Gould, Steve Lambert, and others we created space for screening and discussing a myriad of sociopolitical concerns - from varying notions on utopic ideals, to colonization, the subjectivity of protest imagery, and beyond.

Finding ways to expand upon the ideas embedded with the YTSSP concept and create new outlets for participation and conversation around these compositions led us, for instance, to create separate print pieces that utilized ideas first discussed within YTSSP essays, or conversations which took place during YTSSP screenings, as well as a video link-up between students in Pittsburgh, Penn, and Tehran, Iran wherein playlists were traded between individuals aimed at discussing the perception of the two cultures across a digital divide.
 The YouTube School for Social Politics utilizes surplus knowledge as its driving force, an ephemeral energy source powering sustainable discourse. Scattered throughout YouTube lie countless points of view, disparate moments of histories, both personal and collective. By arranging these video segments - documentaries, personal missives and old family films, newsreels, music videos - new light can be shed on the sociopolitical landscape of history past, and history present. YTSSP invites guest historians, artists, and theorists to construct ""essays"" of socio-historical inquiry through the assemblage of clips found on YouTube.
