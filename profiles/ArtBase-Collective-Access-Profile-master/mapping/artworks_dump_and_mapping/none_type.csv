They did it at least ten years before internet age !First we have to think about Peter Halley who was inspired by the chipset and electronic stuff like mother board for his neo-geo abstract paintings produced at the end of the eighties.Rainer Ganahl and Miltos Manetas have started very soon to deal with computer iconology and environment. Miltos has more dealt with the video game, the computer entertainment revolution and its iconology. Rainer Ganahl has more focused on language concept regarding computer by using the interface metaphor:Rainer has used the guidelines metaphor* He has dealt with it at the age when France was connected to network through minitel !!! (early 80's)For sure rainer Ganahl is according to me a crazy genius who has opened this door in visual art.Surf on these links to see how terrific are these pieces !-http://www.ganahl.info/magers1990.html on 1990 with catalog and reviews1993: An important text by Rainer Ganahl: ""INTERFACIAL PASSAGES 1993""-http://www.ganahl.info/t_intefaces.html1992 view of an installation at Dalllas Art museum:-http://www.ganahl.info/dma_dallasmuseumofart.htmlYou may check also his first ever one person show only on the web at thing.net:1992 NY - trash can and other computer items-http://www.ganahl.info/nordan92.html1996: ""les ateliers"" in Marseille, France-http://www.ganahl.info/lesatelier96.htmlKwangju Biennial, Korea, 1997 commissioned by Harald Szeemann-http://www.ganahl.info/s_ex_kwangju.htmlWithout Rainer Ganahl, the idea of using computer iconology directly in visual art would never emerge !On 1995 another artist called Philip Pocock has printed out a whole website for 'photography after photography' show. On 1996 he did an email reading performance in Berlin with email slide show.At this time, the web interface has not emerged. We can see that these previous work were so closed to webpaintings concept for one simple reason: both of them are dealing with interface iconology. But the web interface is just the son of the computer operating system interface. I have to say if you are just focusing about this point,you are missing another point. Because webpaintings are also dealing with painting iconology and not only computer interface...*J.C Licklider 1905 -1990 was one of the founder of the internet ancestor called arpanet. He has invented the concept of visual interface for computers. Engelbart has conceived on 1964 the first computer mouse to interact with the computer, Licklider got the idea to use it to interact with his visual interface. He did this great job on early seventies. At the Begining of the eighties he got in the Xerox parc the visit of two major personalities in computer industry: Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. We can say today that without Licklider 'windows' software would never exist, and the mac interface would never exist also. By conceiving this kind of interaction with computer on visual level with visual interface and mouse he has defined the concept of ""HMI"": Human and machine interaction. The visual interface conceived by Licklider to interact with computer program has brought the concept of what we call today 'guidelines':For example the main guidelines in Apple system is the apple icon.The icons abd menu in windows software are also guidelines. They help the computer interactor to navigate in the software.2- Webpaintings:Webpaintings project has started on 1998. It is copied worldwilde.

The video starts with ways of finding a lot in the desert, using satellite mages, topographical maps, a compass and strings. It displays ideas and plans on how to improve the land‚Äôs value and documents our preparations to face the unforgiving desert.  In August 2003 we finally went back to the lot and stayed there in order to stop one of the nearby running trains. Train stops have often been the first sign of an infrastructural improvement of an area and are also an option to make a living in the desert. The project consists of 5 steps.1. Purchase: On September 5th, 2002 we purchased 1.1 Acres of land in the desert of Utah on eBay. The seller‚Äôs description promoted a very flat and buildable area with mountain views. There were no building or zoning restrictions.2. Finding:Using satellite images, topographical maps, strings, and a compass, in November of 2002 we went to Utah and located the property. 3. Temporary Use:In December 2002 we established an International Studio Program. After we had sent out a call for proposals in January 2003, a Jury of 6 (curators and artists) chose three artist collaborations, who realized their works on the lot between February and July of 2003.4. Improvements: Because the Union Pacific Train tracks were located about 2000 feet away from the land, our plan for the lot‚Äôs improvement was to create a train stop. This would enhance the areas infrastructure and therefore the value of the lot. To demonstrate the possible reality of this plan a train had to stop at least once in front of the land. In August, 2003 we opened TRAIN STOP INN, a bar, where we served snacks and ice cold drinks for train operators. Temperatures ranged between 90 and 120F. Freight trains, traveling between Las Vegas and Salt Lake City passed in irregular intervals - between 3-5 per day. After 10 days of waiting, a train stopped right in front of our land.5. Auction: After we had improved the lot, we hired a professional auctioneer, organized a public live auction and sold the land for a 10% profit in November of 2003 in New York.",6/13/05 0:00,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/32874/lot/,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/32874/lot/,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,,6/13/05 0:00,,,"Brett Stalbaum and Paula Poole, Collaborative, colonialism, commercialization, Conceptual, Documentary, Event, Eyebeam, HTML, labor, Michael Wilson and Natalie Zimmerman, Narrative, Nevada, New York, Nika Oblak and Primoz Novak, performance, public space, Readymade, social space, space, train stop, utah, eBay, costumes, land, signs, drinks"45919,100+ Hanks,Paul,McLean,Paul McLean,"About 5 years ago, I was invited to submit work to a designer/consultant putting together a collection for Loews Vanderbilt Hotel in Nashville.

This project dovetailed into print work that I'm doing now focused on optic affects experienced by the viewer, depending on POV & distance from the printed object. The choice of image was influenced of course by Wahol, the techniques used to build the image by C Close/R Lichtenstein (Macro) and J Albers/P Mondrian (Micro) & others. This is the first stage of an installation project. Each frame of the slideshow can be output for exhibition in sequence or as wallpaper. The sequence can easily be converted to a QT movie for projection and/or monitor presentation. I invited Adam Cotton to write a sequence of Hank interpretations based on a single riff from one of Hank's songs. I suggested he listen to the Neil Young soundtrack for ""Dead Man"" and the Lynchian soundtracks, especially ""Twin Peaks"". An expanded version will be produced for the installation.

These messages, of up to 160 characters each have been sent to me from my boyfriend, sister, parents, and friends, from phone companies and people offering me SMS porn.160 is exhibited as part of the S19.Afflatus Project, Art for Mobile Devices, www.s19.com.The messages are unedited, a snapshot of what people have been sending me, telling me, asking me.  These are my messages, but not my messages, they are not what I have written, but what I have collected, and chosen to keep. These things mean something to me, as do so many messages to so many people.Whilst we know what we send by SMS, and we know what we receive, we do not have any idea what other people get, how other people compose messages; we have no view into other people‚Äôs phones.   As a Digital Artist, I was keen to explore this with the development of treasuremytext (www.treasuremytext.com).  This project ‚Äò160‚Äô is 160 of my messages stored on treasuremytext.  It is a snapshot made available for anyone else to browse how they choose, to make their own judgements about me, my text life, and the people who send me messages.Most of us have to delete SMS messages we have received from our phones, this collection demonstrates the powerful nature both in the important messages and the mundane ones that can be tracked back over an extended period of time.  Without treasuring these messages they would have been lost, but now have a new life as a text archive which can live away from the mobile phone. The availability of messages for others to take away using their iPod offers people voyeuristic opportunities to explore the content of this work, to try to construct their own stories around the messages they find, to identify their own meaning to build their own picture of those whose mobile lives have touched mine. Much of the content of my messages is humorous, throw away, perhaps pointless; this hints at what the rest of us carry around in our pockets but never show anyone else.Whilst it is possible to get content off a phone onto a computer, or onto a website, this project extends the possibilities for viewing mobile art by making this content available on iPod.  iPod is used as the viewing device, offering greater control for the audience.  The use of iPod also raises questions about ownership of artistic content, each user creates a new version by the act of downloading and viewing the work.",4/1/05 0:00,http://www.s19.com/160/,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: iPod, SMSDate created: 2005-04-01",4/1/05 0:00,,,"Collaborative, download, interface, Katie Lips, Kisky Netmedia, memory, Narrative, nostalgia, offline, privacy, publish, Text"43746,"1833 Chicago City Limits (Chicago, IL)",Christian Marc,Schmidt,Christian Marc Schmidt,"Using sequenced still photography, I trace paths around political and/or historical boundaries within cities, borders which, at one point in time, may have had a profound influence on the urban morphology of a city.",8/17/06 0:00,http://www.christianmarcschmidt.com/index.php?template=project&id=borders_1833,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: documentation, bordersDate created: 2006-08-17New Keywords from user: documentation, bordersDate created: 2006-08-17",8/17/06 0:00,,,"1833 Chicago City Limits, 2006, Christian Marc Schmidt, Conceptual, Conceptual art, Event, immersion, performance, public space, QuickTime, space, video"11697,1953,Skye,Thorstenson,Skyler Thorstenson,"1953 is a comic series about three people trapped in a room of a house with the address 1953. The year is 1953, and the time is 19:53. Inspired by Sartre's play, ""No Exit"" this surreal comic explores the disturbing nature of a person conflicted with their identity and how other's perceive them. Laced with absurd conversations, heated and pointless arguments, and creepy confusion. I chose the year 1953 because around that time, there seemed to be magic in the air. Science and inventions had found a way to make life so much easier for women, safer for children, and exciting for men. But there was a decay festering in the dark rhuemy areas incubating beneath the neon turquoise blue plastic couch covers in the family room. Cancer , breakdown of the nuclear family and ideals, weaker antibodies caused by using ""too much"" new & improved antibacterial soap. There is a lot of regret now and perhaps thoughts like ""Maybe the supposed cheaper meat packaging isn't so good. The plastic and styrofoam does things to the mind. Terrible things. And the nose bleeds...."" Susie, Dorothy and Bob have found themselves caught in a world that is far removed from the year 1953, and as they blindly forge through the day trapped in their house they find their world has become a place of electric wires criss-crossing through a sky polluted with black soot and faint smell of burning chemicals.

It also makes ice cream using the liquid nitrogen that boils out of the suspension portion of the device.  2487 is the year Buck Rogers was taken out of his suspended animation.  At this moment, most people who freeze themselves after death choose to suspend their heads using a process called vitrification, which is cooling to liquid nitrogen temperatures without freezing.

Roussel's story concerns a gentleman scientist, Canterel, who has created a group of absurd machines on his estate outside Paris. They include ""bottle imps."" In Roussel's idiosyncratic usage, bottle imps are pneumatic puppets that act out stories in water-filled crystal chambers. Roussel imagines his bottle imps to be multimedia devices blending motion, sound, and text and existing in a virtual space. It is supposed that Roussel was influenced by Wagnerian Gesamtkunstwerk and the experimental beginnings of cinema. Roussel in turn became an influence on the literary phases of Dada and surrealism (not that Roussel was a member of these or any other groups). I find Locus Solus interesting as a metaphor for much of what's going on in new media literature. With both, the artifice of the medium is a significant part of the message. ""3 Proposals for Bottle Imps"" was an attempt to explore issues of storytelling in which animated text coexists with animation proper. The site evokes something of Roussel's aesthetic of artifice for artifice's sake (a sensibility you find in a lot of new media pieces, actually). I began the piece in mid July 2002 and completed it in early October. I do my own design and coding. With a piece like this, where form and content are closely related, I think it would be tough to do otherwise. Though I did write a first draft of the text of each section before I began laying it out, almost everything was rewritten to fit the screen and the temporal rhythm.--William Poundstone",10/8/02 0:00,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/32164/3Folder/Bottle.html,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,Date created: 2002-10-08,10/8/02 0:00,,,"allegory, Animation, bio, Conceptual, design, Dylan Thomas, Flash, HTML, language, Locus Solus, Luneville, machine, michel foucault, Narrative, Piero di Cosimo, queer, Raymond Roussel, robot, Swansea, Visual"1892,3012,Peter,Luining,Peter Luining,"3012 contains 10 minimal shockwave engines (also refered to as soundtoys)that enables the user to make unique visual & audio compositions.",4/1/04 15:39,http://3012.ctrlaltdel.org/,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/1892/,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"got bio...need longer statement.Date changed: 03/24/04, F.A.

The visitor is invited to watch four characters, on four monitors, as they recount the tragic circumstances of the exhibition's opening night. The experience is unique for each visitor, as each story has most likely never been heard before... and won't ever be heard again.The premise is derived from Akira Kurosawa's film Rashomon, in which four eyewitness accounts of a murder are presented to the viewer, who serves the role of a magistrate. The contradicting stories reveal that objectivity is elusive, as each individual cannot help but infuse his story, consciously or not, with personal shame and ambition. It is unclear who is lying, or if it matters. Each story holds a valid reality of its own, a subjective truth that reinforces a desired identity. However, perhaps there could be another layer: in addition to stories that differ between tellers, might an individual's story change with each new telling? 5 'til 12 proposes that we evolve multiple narratives as we explore multiple identities.The process is inspired by the Oulipo literary movement, in particular the canonical piece by Raymond Queneau, One Hundred Thousand Billion Sonnets, in which 'potential' literature emerges when lines of words are spliced and recombined. 5 'til 12 draws from the artists' own journals, fantasies, and parodies, all of which are algorithmically assembled to create an enormous number of potential personas for each character.Stories are selected from the possibilities in rounds, using a programmatic variation on the Prisoner's Dilemma, a model from game theory where individuals choose to cooperate or not in order to maximize their own personal advantage. Seeking to portray themselves in the best possible light, the characters must choose to be complimentary, neutral, or vindictive toward each other. A character who appears confident and blameless while illustrating everyone else's faults will 'score' the highest. However, in the following round, he or she can expect revenge and must eventually make amends. The strategy of each character is adapted using an evolutionary algorithm according to its effectiveness in each round.The installation uses RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) cards to identify individual visitors. When each new visitor swipes a card, a new story is selected, and the visitor is recognized as he or she explores the narrative space.In the last few minutes of the final hour, anything is possible.

This opens up new and interesting possibilities, but also raises questions that should be kept in consideration and that need to be dealt with: by using the Kindle, and by feeding it with books we buy on Amazon, we're giving up a big part of our self-determination over our personal libraries, our reading devices, and over the selection of books that we can read.

In late 1999 an anonymous man found the image and applied a whole new identity, Asian Prince onto this retired rock star's image. After this secondary manipulation, 60X1.com comes in and remanipulates the readymade identity. The manipulations can have several directions. I can erase the post original and apply a new set of meanings onto the figure or simply extend an already constructed identity. This process of altering meaning and identity can only be seen in the internet realm because the creator/manipulator usually perceives the internet as a medium that does not have to bear too much responsibility (no censorship) while publishing controversial material. One interesting anecdote is one morning I actually received a phone call from a woman who desperately wanted to meet Asian Prince, thus taking the process of three constructed and shifting identities and their subsequent meanings and turning it once more with a fourth process-elements of the virtual world transcend and become reality.60X1.COM will keep proliferating until it reaches sixty splash pages.Keep clicking the 'enter",9/1/01 0:00,http://www.111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111.com/,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/3308/www.111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111.com/,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: humor, navigationComments from user: one-way navigationDate created: 2001-09-01Date cloned: 2013-02-22",9/1/01 0:00,,,"commercialization, Conceptual, design, DHTML, Generative, homepage, HTML, interface, Internet, Java, Javascript, Kenneth Tin-Kin Hung, meme, netart, postmodern, Readymade, Visual"30674,718/303-9553,Sonic Supper,,Sonic Supper ,"Sonic Supper is a friendly venue for curious music.

In addition to the gallery installation I plan to make a separate audio CD of chimes music which can also be streamed over the internet as sound-art. ‚Äú95 Chimes‚Äù is a digital sound sculpture/installation that relates string theory to music (see ‚ÄúNew York Arts Magazine‚Äù) and the origin of matter and provides a three-dimensional musical metaphor for these smallest particles of matter and the harmonies, vibrations, and energies they produce. It was recorded in Sept. 2005, in the Banff Center for the Art‚Äôs Luscar recording studio under a co-sponsorship grant.  The project was first presented at the ASCI SciArt Symposium in 2002 at the Museum of Natural History in conjunction with the Einstein exhibit. It has been nominated for a Creative Capital  grant and mentioned in Stephen Wilson‚Äôs Information Arts (MIT Press 2003).

Suddenly a boat comes, then the next frame its vanished, leaving only its wake.Or there's nothing but a still shot of a canal. There's nothing happening and suddenly two birds fly across. You are entranced into a state of reverie.It is the time to invent new forms of cultural imaginary. I present another type of view to the political and economic pace of trade e.g. a slow cargo coal boat, embedded within the fast pace of communication technology. Timing is drawing on combination of magic (Vaudeville) show, a collision of times and places within a continual series of tableaux vivants. The work is live and multi-nodal, it calls into question where the 'object' actually is - is it located at the server or as projected on site in Hobart? Or in-between, the interstices of the world? In a sense the work is un-locatable, its point of origin is continually shifting. A cargo boat on a canal, is soon gone as in the next frame we only see its wake. For Foucault, heterotopias are real spaces -distinct from non-existent or ""virtual"" utopian spaces - that seize and activate the imagination, that ""are absolutely different from all the sites they reflect and speak about."" These are "" counter-sites"" within which ""all the other real sites that can be found within the culture are simultaneously represented, contested, and inverted (1986:24)"". Of course, the media I develop is essential to this task, combining attention and distraction in complex ways, I ask the viewer to look critically, upon the object of distracted examination, as a site of reflection upon these meanings and possibilities. The incremental changes are perceptible through refreshing of the frame, also in the light and the mood of the water. At times the canal is completely still, empty. Suddenly, a boat comes. Maybe for hours there is nothing but a dark body of water. There is nothing happening and suddenly two birds fly across, you are entranced into a state of reverie. This continuous live feed gazes at the viewer behind her back, making its own claim on their time. The dialectics of emplacement, attention and distraction is also a dialectics of duration. This is a dialectics of continuity and interruption of rhythm. As such, it is a particular inflection of the process of temporalisation - the production of time - itself. The web-cast, a live succession of stills in the art space intervenes into the temporal dialectic, syncopating the time of the viewer into new rhythms and forms. New reflective rhythms of absorption and distraction, new articulations of duration, interruption, beginning, ending, repetition and delay. In the temporal structure of relationships between action, duration is a dialectical process of continuity, interruption, and beginning again. The fundamental concept of time is thus not continuity but temporisation as rhythm. The fundamental concept of a general rhythmics is the restoration of form.",5/15/05 0:00,http://sistero.sysx.org/mythengine/tradestream/index.html,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/32782/tradesmallis.mov,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: translocalComments from user: Running time: continuous live feed, no audio, color.A live video feed from a room in my house captures the canal outside my window, a well traversed trade route into Amsterdam.

This is not an ""arts"" project.  It is a ""crafts"" project.THE PLAN: There will be 9 squares.  The entire quilt will be 450 X 450px.

For example, mine would reside at http://www.lab404.com/quilt.gif  If this naming convention presents a problem, just put it somewhere else and tell me where you put it.Your gif can actually be any dimension, just be aware that it will be called into the page at 150X150.  The squares will directly abutt each other with no borders.  The outer edge of the entire quilt will have a 1 pixel black border.You can change your gif as little or as often as you like.  Just make a new gif and overwrite your old one in the same location, and the quilt will be automatically updated.  Feel free to use or remix gifs that you've already made.  I don't care.  All that is up to you.You can participate in as many different quilts as you like.

To be and to be seen, to want and to be wanted, these desires take form in sexual display. Among humans sexual display has different values depending on whether it's private, which is acceptable, or public, where it is pornography or erotica.  Even erotica has shady connotations because of the devaluation of the pleasure principle in Western culture.  Yet because sexuality is such a powerful force we all feel a desire to communicate our personal reaction or else to see how others behave.  In this process we inform ourselves / others and create shared culture.A Kodak Moment is a validation of the erotic quality  in human life.__________________ A Kodak Moment is about the pleasure of being seen and of the gaze.  It is recorded in a new form of digital immortality which competes with the permanence of marble sculpture and ancient oil paintings, and trancends the transient and private venue of photography and motion film.A Kodak Moment was a collaboration between myself and my girlfriend at the time, a visual artist-photographer named Roma Czernysz.  Roma, seeing herself in the work, said ‚ÄúShe's someone other than I. She lives in the photographs...but also in life.

Defining a prime as a number that is only divisible by one and itself, one is a prime. However, for purposes of factorization and especially the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, it is more convenient to not think of one as a prime factor, or to think of it as an implicit factor that's always there but need not be written down. To exclude the number one from the list of prime numbers, primality is defined as a number having exactly two distinct positive divisors, one and itself. The last professional mathematician to publicly label 1 a prime number was Henri Lebesgue in 1899. (Carl Sagan included one in a list of prime numbers in his book Contact in 1985.)One is one of three possible return values of the M√∂bius function.

The piece uses voice recognition and text-to-speech as well as max programming. The four vehicles are essentially performers. The work involves the four characters talking to each other or singing. Sinclair and Hovagimyan also perform with the characters, by playing guitar or talking to the characters. A pitch tracking software allows the laptops to listen to a string of notes and sing along. The characters respond to each other via keywords that trigger responses thus affecting natural conversation. The characters cars are controlled by perfomers. The performances were concieved of as unique and evolutive. The artists created new content and programming structures for each performance. As a consequence there are several difference titles for this performance work denoting the different developments. The alternate titles are: Exercises in Talking and Les Jaseurs. ---- A Soapopera for iMacs. ----The piece consists of four iMacs sitting on found furniture in a salon like setting . The piece uses voice recognition and text-to-speech as well as max programming. There are 4 characters Ralph, Princess, Kathy and Fred. They talk to each other. The conversations are rather mundane. They talk about cars, sex, shopping, politics and food. They also burst into song at odd moments. Each computer responds to spoken keywords by the other computers or a viewer. Often the words are misunderstood and the conversation takes off in bizarre directions.",5/15/98 0:00,http://nujus.net/~nujus/html/soapopNu-1.html,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/39576/html/soapopNu-1.html,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"Date created: 1998-05-15Date cloned: 2013-02-08Appended Tech Details=====================Pure Data, Text-to-Speech, voice recognition, robotics",5/15/98 0:00,,,"Ars Electronica, art world, artificial life, audio, Burlesques Contemporain, Collaborative, collider, Conceptual, Database, desire, Event, exhibition, FR, globalization, GMEM, historical, HTML, identity, installation, interface, Jeu du Paume, language, live, machine, Marseilles, Max/MSP, memory, MP3, Narrative, network, offline, Paris, performance, Peter Sinclair, posthuman, Postmasters Gallery, QuickTime, Readymade, robot, social space, software, Text"47136,"A Society of Stickpeople (captured, #31)",Nathan,Selikoff,Nathan Selikoff,"In 2004, I created a graphics program that simulated a population of stickmen and stickwomen through various iconic stages of life: birth, play, love, work, rest, travel, and death.

Each movement taking place within the field of vision of the camera is represented on the screen as a rectangle having dimensions proportional to the wideness of the movement: wide movements (i.e. of the whole body) generate wide rectangles, limited movements (i.e. of hands) produce little rectangles. The application software manages color and blend of rectangles in such a way as to obtain the best visual result. Each combination of colors (chromatic chord) is corresponding to a combination of musical notes played by a grand piano (musical chord): the wideness of the rectangle generated by the user of the work determines the note of the chord played: the wider is the rectangle, the lower is the selected note among the notes of the chord. The work was more conceived as an image generation tool than as a musical instrument, however the user may let his/her movements be driven either by aesthetic sense or ear for music. If the user, after a certain period of activity, remains still for some seconds, the application software considers the visual result as satisfactory for the user and records the image displayed onto the screen.

In their book Metaphors We Live By, George Lakoff and Mark Johnson explain how this is metaphorically true. The language we use to talk about arguments is a language of war. We ""attack"" our opponents positions and ""defend"" our own. We ""shoot down"" opposing arguments. We say that claims are ""defensible"" or ""indefensible."" We talk of ""winning"" and ""losing"" arguments. In arguing we have ""tactics"" and ""strategies."" We are ""on target"" or ""off target"" in our criticisms. We ""gain ground"" or ""lose ground."" In fact, it is not simply that we talk about arguments like this, this is what we do. Lakoff and Johnson ask us to consider a culture in which arguments are not conceptualized as verbal warfare, but as collaborative dances: participants are not opponents but partners and each counter-move is a balanced, graceful response. That would be a very different world. Of course the latter is not an alien idea. Philosophers have long distinguished the constructive, cooperative art of conversation (dialectics) from verbal combat (rhetoric). However, the problem has often been that -- when the cool reason of conversation comes in contact with the heated emotion of argumentation -- rhetoric melts dialectic and we get a shouting match rather than a reasoned debate. What can be done? There is an argument about arguments and it has at least two sides. On one side, the advice given is of a moral quality: To allow reason to prevail over rage, calm everyone down. Make everyone follow the rules of calm and reasonable conversation and disallow the shouts and unruly outbursts of the arguing parties. The other side is neither moral nor immoral but opportunistic. This side is usually the one politicians listen to when they are running for office or ruling a state. The other side starts with the assumption that any verbal interaction will eventually become a shouting match so the best preparation is voice training and acting lessons, so that -- when the transition to shouting is at hand -- one can shout loud enough to make one's emotional appeal. The former is the utopian, Enlightenment ideal of reasoned debate, rational politics, democracy and verbal diplomacy; the latter is our world, the world of image, charisma, negative advertising, power politics, and war. But, if we want deliberative debate, democracy and diplomacy, how do we get from here to there? Political philosophers have been arguing about arguing for a long time. Even though the most of this territory is occupied by the two sides described above, a third ""camp"" is emerging. (Hmm. There's that metaphor again!) The third camp tries to break up the fight between the moral conversationalists and the political rhetoricians by attempting to get everyone off the battlefield and to reconsider the shape and forms of the field of engagement. Lakoff and Johnson do this by making us examine the language we use to describe what we are doing when we argue. Political theorists like Chantal Mouffe provide us with alternatives by pointing out that -- even if argument is war -- war is just one form (although a deadly form) of contest between adversaries. Mouffe's alternative to a utopic, moral, deliberative democracy is -- what she calls -- an ""agonistic pluralism"" where agon is understood as the ancient Greek term denoting ""A public celebration of games; a contest for the prize at those games; or, a verbal contest or dispute between two characters in a Greek play"" (OED). Political theorists, like Mouffe, interested in the democratic potential of agonistic contests, oftentimes recast deliberative discussion as a language game -- in the sense invented by Ludwig Wittgenstein. Moreover, this reimagining of politics leans heavily on Friedrich Nietzsche's understanding of agonistics and ancient Greek philosophy. A close look at the writings of this set of political theorists (which must also include Jean-Francois Lyotard, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, and Bruno Latour) rewards one with the following insight: just as Lakoff and Johnson show how everyday thinking about arguments draws on a set of metaphorical images and actions, so do these theorists assume a different set of metaphorical images and actions to describe verbal contests -- specifically, game like images and actions. Neither are these images and actions the moral frameworks of, for example, Jurgen Habermas and other moralists hoping for perfect conditions for communicative interaction. Nor, are these images and actions the violent ones implied by the commonsense metaphor ""argument is war."" What then are these images and actions? Two sorts of evidence can be gathered from a close reading of these theorists. One sort of evidence is articulated in the form of broad outlines or ""sketches"" for envisioning such a game. Chantal Mouffe provides an example of such a ""sketch"" in her article entitled ""Deliberative Democracy or Agonistic Pluralism?"": ""pluralist politics should be envisaged as a 'mixed-game', i.e., in part collaborative and in part conflictual and not as a wholly co-operative game as most liberal pluralists would have it."" More specific, detailed, ""diagrammatic"" evidence comes from theorists who provide us with, what Gilles Deleuze calls, ""thought images."" One such influential thought images is that coined by Deleuze and Guattari to describe non-hierarchical forms of knowledge and power; i.e., the rhizome. As demonstrated by online forums, like rhizome.org, such a thought image can influence an extensive information architecture. However, even more substantial than these verbal descriptions are the graphically rendered diagrams that are sometimes ventured by theorists like Bruno Latour in his book Science in Action, a Nietzschean look at the agonistic dynamics of presumably democratic, scientific debate and controversy. Mouffe, Deleuze, Latour and others have provided us with a reimagining of democratic debate as a contest to link, unlink, build and dissolve assemblages of people and things.",1/1/04 0:00,http://hybrid.ucsc.edu/Agonistics,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,Date created: 2004-01-01,1/1/04 0:00,,,"allegory, Animation, artificial life, Collaborative, community, conference, Database, Formalist, game, HTML, interact, language, live, Participatory, performance, publish, Text"32185,Airstream,Abinadi,Meza,abinadi meza,"This is an improvisational collage of signal-processed room tone, white noise, and electronic hum.

Introduction to Arturo Herrera's Almost Homeby Lynne CookeDiptychs are relatively rare in the history of Western art. Most often, they take the form of paired, identically scaled panels, whose twin structures posit a duality that typically resides in contrast and opposition rather than complementarity. Life and death, positive and negative, before and after - such binaries become their underlying themes and in turn evoke other antitheses equally fundamental to Western thought and culture: good and evil, light and dark, inside and outside... In Almost Home, Arturo Herrera invites the viewer of his website project to become a player in an ersatz game that involves such fundamentals, albeit now couched in the vocabulary of childhood fantasy. The spectator is offered the option of creating diptychs to his or her own taste from the hundred collages which constitute the storehouse or deck in Herrera's singular pack of cards. Yet this act of composition is inherently constrained, if not compromised, by the fact that, given that each collage is programmed to appear randomly, even the most patient player may never fully apprehend the full spectrum in this mutant series. More importantly, since the presence of any particular collage is serendipitously determined, the viewer can only accept or reject a pairing, eliminating one or the other half of the diptych until a preferred combination appears. To make ""sense"" of any conjunction is the gauntlet thrown to the player, a challenge heightened by the fact that each component is in itself a visual conundrum. Further dramatizing this insouciant provocation is the barely perceptible movement or change that occurs in some twenty of the images. For the less than highly attentive viewer these subtle shifts may pass unnoticed, or will be glimpsed tardily, too late to be properly observed, identified, and analyzed. Moreover, when a player finally spies these irregular, often almost imperceptible and incongruous shifts, he or she is likely to become even more unsettled, or disturbed, preternaturally anxious in case others pass by unregarded. Hyperalert, afraid of missing the telling transformation, the revealing sleight of hand, the clue that betrays or deflects, the viewer engages more deeply in the once innocuous situation so that it increasingly assumes an enthralling emotional charge. Whether such transmutations are interpreted as whimsical and arbitrary, capricious and teasing, or, conversely, portentous clues, crucial keys, to unravelling an otherwise enigmatic situation, depends on the kind of psychic investment with which the player participates. Filled with expectation, yet unable to do more than accept or reject these chance sequences and couplings, the player is brought to acknowledge how slight is the possibility of accounting for this familiar realm. Here revealed in its most basic because most unconstrained guise, it betrays itself as slippery and elusive where formerly it was familiar and comforting, known and knowable.The alluring glow that the luminous screen imparts to each construction melds the diverse elements in the collage into a seamless whole. Once differences in paper stock, texture, weight, and color are eliminated, a convincing and compelling illusion supervenes. This is a world whose wholeness cannot easily be dissected, for its fractures have been concealed, notwithstanding the miscellany of sources from which the components have been culled: comics, children's books, cards, and cartoons. This illusory wholeness counters the mysterious incongruity that marks the protagonists and events within, as figures metamorphize, mutate, and hybridize in a rambunctiously rampant, polymorphously perverse play. As unfettered desire constantly overturns the rules of decorum transgression proves at once destructive and blithely creative. Unfettered, liberated from the norms of order, convention, consequence, and causality, the tropes of childhood imaginary are reversed, and, inverted, their boundaries elided so that inside and outside, micro and macro, and most other coordinates become indeterminate if not illegible. The virtual space of the screen, the fantasy space of childhood tales and psychic space, collapse into each other. Yet while seeming to give free reign to wishes, impulses, and desires previously thwarted or sublimated or simply unrecognized or unacknowledged, Herrera rigorously resists romanticizing the image repertoire of childhood memory. He regalvanizes those transgressive impulses, at once destructive, transforming, and transporting that lie at the heart of play for both child and adult alike, and that therefore render the ludic a prime locus for manifestations of the unconscious in some of its most untrammelled and ecstatic displays. As Maria Tatar argues, by harnessing the messy, subversive energy characteristic of the child to the shameless erotic ",8/29/01 16:34,http://www.diacenter.org/herrera/index.html,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/1824/index.html,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,Date cloned: 2013-01-31,8/29/01 16:34,,,"Almost Home, Arturo Herrera, Dia, Flash, HTML, Visual"3851,Alpha Beta Disco: Godard Remix,DropBox,,DropBox,"DropBox flattens Godard's film ""Alphaville"" (1965) into a database containing every scene, line of dialogue, sound effect and measure of the orchestral score.

I am interested in digital media to create collaborative, hypermedia wreadings of literary texts. Following Genette¬¥s forms of paratextuality, the process of quoting or re-writing a text involves an hypotext - the antecedent, imitated literary text (Clarice Lispector's ‚ÄúAmor‚Äù); and an hypertext, the text that imitates the hypotext (the poem ‚ÄúAmor de Clarice‚Äù). From hypertext to hypermedia, both texts were recorded by the actor Nuno M. Cardoso, and later transcribed to Macromedia‚Äôs Flash program, where I made the integration of sound, animation, and interactivity. To enter the poem and its main menu, click on the words ‚ÄúINICIAR POEMA‚Äù on the bottom. There are 52 flash movies, with an average duration of 1 minute each, which can be browsed from the main menu, or, in both linear of random ways, using the icons on the top of each movie. There are two different types of movies. From the main menu, on the left, there are links to 26 movies in which the main poem (the hypertext) appears as animated text, which can be clicked, and dragged by the reader, with sounds assigned to the words; the original text (the hypotext) is also present, as a multilayered, visually appealing, but static background. The sound for theses movies was created by  Carlos Morgado using recordings with readings of the poem. On the right, there are links to 26 movies with the same animated hypertext/poem, but where the hypotext in the background of the previous is replaced by video frames, animated and manipulated by Ana Carvalho. The sound files for these movies was designed by Luis Aly, integrating recordings with readings of the short-story. The use of the three basic matrixes (the verbal, the visual, and the sound) can be found in all experimental poetics: concrete, visual and sound poetry have challenged the order of writing. And digital media combine, in an articulate and intuitive manner, these three matrixes. Like experimental poetry, digital poetry promotes processuality (incompleteness, open-work); interactivity (wreading, re-writing); hypermediality (integration, convergence); and networking (interaction, collaboration).",7/1/05 0:00,http://telepoesis.net/amor,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/35811/amor.html,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: poetryDate created: 2005-07-01Date cloned: 2013-04-24",7/1/05 0:00,,,"Amor de Clarice, Ana Carvalho, Animation, audio, Carlos Morgado, CD-ROM, CETIC, Collaborative, Conceptual, contextual, digital, Flash, gender, interact, language, Luis Aly, memory, MP3, Narrative, Nuno M.

Evolving pieces exist, that the  ""user"" has to control of and makes them work by movement., The user also  can input changes of sound and picture. This change in the relationship  between the audience and the artist changes our perception of the  artwork. It is this concept of the individual functioning simultaneously  as 'producer and consumer' that underpins the nature of AMORPHISMS. The  user can choose what they experience.

This rather pragmatic analysis has led me to cognify a digitality in the the work that has become a formative part of my aesthetic of some, but not all works, specifically a body of works I am calling ""Volumetric Gestures"".The visual language of these works speaks in terms of the bitmap and the vector as well as form, line, gesture, and action; the aesthetic could be called ""digitalist"" perhaps, since ""digital"" simply describes a binary transcription.After completing a series of images working with 3D wireframe chalice forms, I was introduced by art historian Andrew Hershberger to the wireframe goblets of Paolo Ucello, hand-drawn in pencil with machinelike precision by the artist in 1450. This closed a circle for me, and made me realize the circularity and connectedness of time and thought.In the incorporation of technology-based art media in my studio practice, I feel there is a new modernism which I seek; one which escapes the postmodern loop and lives in the moment, a place beyond context. Data has been aestheticised, and aesthetics have been coded; we as artists are in a position of responsibility to leave some artifacts behind. The physical and data objects which I create are documents; created equally for the self, the stranger, and the process of creation. -cag 011507 Vector animation with video and electronic music",1/15/07 0:00,http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1067221249053837185&q=colin+goldberg,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: postdigital,digitalist,audiovisual,ipod video,mp4Comments from user: Audiovisual Electronica / Video Art / Digital Art A technodelic piece of short video art, experimenting with combining drawing with videoDate created: 2006New Keywords from user: postdigital,digitalist,audiovisual,ipod video,ipod,ipod moviesComments from user: A piece of short video art, experimenting with a technodelic aesthetic using the combination of animation and videography in the artmaking process; this work derives from the artist's Volumetric Gestures series of mixed-media works.  Date created: 2007-01-15New Keywords from user: postdigital,digitalist,audiovisual,ipod video,ipod,ipod moviesComments from user: A piece of short video art, experimenting with a technodelic aesthetic using the combination of animation and videography in the artmaking process; this work derives from the artist's Volumetric Gestures series of mixed-media works.  Date created: 2007-01-15",1/15/07 0:00,,,"Abstract, Anamorphic, Animation, audio, cinema, Colin Goldberg, Conceptual, digital, Formalist, futurism, historical, meme, Narrative, offline, QuickTime, television, video"49119,ancestralworship.com,Duncan,Malashock,Duncan Malashock,A brightly-colored sculpture moves slowly through a grey space.,5/26/09 0:00,http://www.ancestralworship.com/,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,,5/26/09 0:00,,,"Animation, code, electricity, Fake, Interactive art, Internet, neon, plastic, Sculpture, simulation, Technology, Virtual reality, weight"1858,Animal Locomotion,Myron,Turner,Myron Turner,"Using Muybridge and Thomas Eakins as a point of departure, Myron Turner explores animal and human locomotion, reimaging digitized and photographed subjects into drawings that then can be seen in many states and statges of movement and disintegration.

Derrida extends this dichotomy to ‚Äútext‚Äù, specifically written text, which both preserves a trail of the author‚Äôs experience and simultaneously falsifies it.

Women were encouraged to act and react publicly, and art, as a primarily public issue, became a strong vehicle for this discourse. One of the main questions was - what makes women different from men, and in point of art - what makes women artists and their art different from male artists. This was a main discourse in the United States, Great Britain and Germany, which has spread over to many other cultures since the 1970s. Women reflected upon the patriarchal social system, in history, in art history and in current affairs. It was a great benefit for later developments and changes, although it was a big struggle. Feminist art cannot be understood apart from this struggle. The term 'feminist art' could be misleading, since the word feminism is often connected in its general and popular use - referring to fighting against men - but feminism is definitely not sexism. The term 'feminism' in connection with art should be used in the sense of understanding art works in a way of a female perspective, which, while not excluding the struggle, is more concerned with creating a recognition of a female position, in either counterpart or rather subject position. This position is a critical engagement with gender issues and views art as a socio-political matter. It is a generally accepted fact that in Western culture‚Äôs patriarchal heritage the preponderance of art made by males and for male audience often transgressed against females, or used females as passive objects. The male studio system excluded women from training as artists, the gallery system kept women from exhibiting and selling their work, as well as from being collected by museums (albeit somewhat less in recent years then before). Linda Nochlin (American, contemporary art critic) wrote her article ""Why have there been no great women artists?"" in 1971, and gave an impetus for numerous published histories of women artists. A tremendous momentum for feminist scholarship concerning women in the arts ensued, offering the work of many more women artists overdue recognition. ""We could say that the social conditions have changed enormously to facilitate more female participation in the arts and greater recognition of women artist's merits. But some people might suspect instead we have watered down or altered old notions of greatness and genius.""[1] As the notion of genius became tied to men, there were intrinsic shifts and diagnoses of Rousseau and Kant. Feminists criticized canons as the enshrinement of traditional ideas about what makes for 'greatness' in art, ""... and this 'greatness' always seems to exclude women"".[2] ""The feminist asks how canons have become constructed, when, and for what purposes. Canons are described as 'ideologies' or belief systems that falsely pretend to objectivity when they actually reflect power and dominance relations. ... Perhaps instead of creating a new and separate female canon, we need to explore what existing canons reveal.""[3] The first two decades of art and feminism are seen as a revolt against male artists and their politics of production, consumption and targeting art, as well as the male-created gaze and male-dominated society. Female artists now find themselves concerned with evolving art in an aesthetics and with strategies including the social discourse. Feminist art has gained a relevant status and is highly approved and legitimated as an ongoing debate. These new ways of viewing the position of women and women artists in a socio-cultural context and in a critical philosophic manner is no longer defined as a revolt against patriarchal systems, rather it is accepted as a debate concerning disclosure and deconstruction of sex and gender in a patriarchal system, and reflects both construction and discourse within an historical context. ""Although there is little consensus among women at the present time about where to go next, and although many goals of the Women's Movement have not been met - there is still violence against women, discrimination in education and employment, racism, and sexism in daily life - contemporary art by women reveals the formulation of complex strategies and practices through which they are confronting the exclusion of art history, expanding theoretical knowledge, and promoting social change.""[4] ArtFem.TV as Cyberfeminist Action New media offers new possibilities and chances, but also comprehends old restrictions and patterns. Works in the field of new media, feminism and art are a way to subvert the public economic tradition and offer new views, perspectives and possibilities to use new media with female agendas to undergo a shift from the male technocratic society, where knowledge, money and power go in one hand to strengthen male interests and visions. Cyberfeminism can be an answer to tech-malestream, as VNS Matrix (Francesca da Rimini, Josephine Starrs, Julianne Piercel, Virginia Barratt) the early Australian cyberfeminists stated: ""mission to hijack the tools of the techno-cowboys and remap technoculture with a feminist bent""[5] in an active and not passive user role. Core cyberfeminist actions are aesthetic/artistic strategies, not only as deconstruction of representations of gender, but also of traditional concepts on the net and in the institutions of tech-culture. Terms of these practices are to recode, remap, relocate, reconstruct. Cyberfeminist projects do not work as a massive front in a manner of counter cultural movements, they are subversive, infiltrating the mainstream with ironic breaks, citations and deformations.[6] Within this context, ArtFem.TV is an attempt to break with a male dominated net-culture and media landscape to highlight women's emphases in art and media works.  References:1.

Instead of biometrics and radio frequency ID chips, Artistic License embraces freedom, collaboration, sharing, and imagination as keys to a more appealing modernity. Your Artistic License doesn't require you to look like yourself, and it does not impose factual restrictions. Nonetheless it has the truthiness coveted by authority.///Artistic License was conceived primarily as a form of net.art that is experienced by people around the world through their browsers.  During some exhibition events, however, it is possible to produce laminated licenses directly in the gallery space, as occurred in September 2009 in Hartford, Connecticut.///Although in many respects it's fun, Artistic License encourages card-holders to swipe across the borders of technology and identity. The greater socio-political context for this work includes privacy and personal liberty issues.  Emerging identification technologies like biometrics, RFID transmitters, facial recognition software, GPS devices, microvideo, and nanotechnology have already disrupted basic life ways.  The continuing changes have affected freedom of behavior and identity, constraining the imagination in the name of a security that is never truly achieved. Artistic License entertains the possibility that imagination, rather than restriction and control, is the key to avoiding the dystopian misadventures that are coming into focus. ///While interactive art has been online for decades, basic assumptions about the division of labor between the artist and the spectator haven't changed substantially.  Artistic License targets this issue ironically, using the co-creation of ID cards - artistic licenses - as the engine for an open-ended series. The results are somewhat unpredictable. The various contributions are performative, rebellious, naive, sophisticated, vulgar, etc.  What distinguishes one license from the next is a matter of personal choice.

Ideally, these systems permit their interactants to engage in a flow state of pure experience.The AVES systems are built around the metaphor of an inexhaustible and dynamic audiovisual ""substance,"" which is freely deposited and controlled by the user's gestures. Each instrument situates this substance in a context whose free-form structure inherits from the visual language of abstract painting and animation. The use of low-level synthesis techniques permits the sound and image to be tightly linked, commensurately malleable, and deeply plastic. The AVES systems inhabit a domain at the juncture of art, design, and the engineering of tools and instruments. As artworks, they extend an established Twentieth century tradition in which artworks are themselves generative systems for other media.

Here the wealth of information within a library is a metaphor for the abundance of information on the web. The new navigation system features a pulsating array of numerical information that changes size and color depending on the position of the mouse. Clicking on a DDC number launches the corresponding website in a new window. Babel is a site specific work for a non-site. The context of the work is non-physical. The site is an abstract thing...information space and the taxonomy of knowledge that all libraries represent...which the Internet, where the project is realised, is.The Dewey Decimal numbering system, used in the cataloguing of library contents, is the key metaphor, visualised in a three dimensional multi-user space that is itself a metaphor for the infinite nature of information.In Babel, the Dewey Decimal system is used as a mapping and navigation technique. The structure of the library is re-mapped into the hyper-spatial that constitutes the Web. The Dewey numbering system is employed as a means to navigate the internet itself, the taxonomy inherent in the numerical codes mapping onto web-sites that conform with the defined subjects.The Dewey Decimal system is based on two concepts; firstly that each area of knowledge can be defined as a number and that the space between each numbered area is infinitely divisible. This allows the cataloguing system to be both navigable in its subject headings whilst able to contain an infinite number of potential entries in the catalogue. As such, it is a simultaneously finite macrocosmic and infinite microcosmic system.In Babel, viewers logged onto the site are confronted with a 3D visualisation of an abstract data space mapped as arrays and grids of Dewey Decimal numbers. As they move the mouse around the screen they are able to navigate this 3D environment. All the viewers are able to see what all the other viewers, who are simultaneously logged onto the site, are seeing.

Baghdad's Skyline is a grim reminder of the death and devastation the Iraqi people face on a daily basis in the wake of America‚Äôs misguided invasion. Baghdad Skyline transforms New York City with augmented reality into a war-torn battle ground that parallels Baghdad. The aim of this piece is to increase awareness of the daily violence faced by the Iraqi people.During the work, plumes of smoke unfurl through the skyscrapers and trail across a projected panorama of NYC. The explosions causing the lingering smoke will be scaled to inflict a proportionate level of damage upon the city of Manhattan as in Baghdad. The explosions and trailing smoke are dictated by information parsed from the Internet related to violence in Iraq. One weeks worth of violence will overlay Manhattan in the projected image. The size of the included explosions will be scaled to match those taking place in Iraq. The project does its best to take into account the population densities as well population movement according to the time of day in both cities.New York City was chosen for the project because of its location and charged historical ties to the Iraq conflict. New York City, as a project site, lets Americans see their own land under constant attack. The horrific events which took place on September 11 left everlasting wounds in the hearts of New Yorkers and the rest of the world. Sadly, these tragic events were intentionally manipulated and used to lead America to war.

Images andtexts are juxtaposed layering information and creating links between the social, political and the personal. Balkan Layers: Macedonian Diary is an interactive Web project based on my impressions of Macedonia during the Fall and Winter of 1998-1999 while I was in Skopje on a Senior Fulbright grant. I have chosen to create digital images because they can be layered in a way that reflects the layers of changing culture, society, history, geology and politics.  The information (images and narrative) is organized in parallel segments that can be viewed in any order - using the branching structure of data. This gives impressions of the whole experience rather than telling a linear story.The Internet is a perfect forum in which to present this project. The diary-like impressions are presented in an intimate and personal format. The interactive experience, as with most web sites will often be solitary and private. At the same time, the scope of the project will have a global reach because of its topical subject matter and location on the Internet. The BORDERLESS nature of the Internet is here used to express content about an area whose geographic borders have always been in flux. Also, the dynamic nature of the Web allows for evolution and reinvention -- a Web project is, by its nature, always a work in progress mutating and evolving in response to the world around.The design is simple and the navigation is relatively easy. I have chosen not to use plugins and I have made a deliberate effort to keep files small and reduce visual noise. While I was in Macedonia I gained a new appreciation for the Internet access that we have in America. Most people of the world do not have Internet connections and computers. Those that do have access often have limited and expensive access and poor connections. For example, in Macedonia people pay by the pulse and by the minute. To make the work more accessible I have streamlined my use of large files.

The meaningless fragment, thus, is able to duplicate itself and transfer its working schemes, namely to tune on itself the senses and percepts of the videolisteners. What was said is really of no importance.The ber.loose.coin project presents a prototype device for the optimization of such a mechanism, trying to facilitate politicians' life. It removes the burden of contents, still used just as a makeup tool for the speech, and preserves the molecules of rhythm, vision and sound, thus constituting a sort of drum machine for electoral speeches. The choice of Silvio Berlusconi (the former prime minister of Italy, who was in charge at the time ber.loose.coin was realized) as the experimental material is almost incidental, apart for the fact that he seemed to us the person that is closest to this kind of political practice.",4/7/06 0:00,http://www.malloc.it/ber.loose.coin.html,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"Comments from user: The artwork was realized and first shown on the internet on 2006-04, at the time of the last political campaign of mr b.Date created: 2006-04-07",4/7/06 0:00,,,"artificial life, audio, Collaborative, Documentary, Flash, game, Italia, language, media activism, Participatory, QuickTime, resistance, Ruben Coen Cagli, software, Stefano Perna, tactical, tactical media, television"2909,berceuse,Zahra,Safavian,Zahra Safavian,"""berceuse"" is a virtual reality panorama in which multiple layers of text are embedded.

Birds use their beaks and throats to alter the musical quality of their song like humans use their mouth and throats to change theirs.  Language is innate and therefore genetic.  Its essential structures can be found in other species like songbirds who possess the same FoxP2 gene that is responsible for language in humans.""Birdsongs: The language gene"" uses songs and calls recorded from nature to reconfigure them digitally as human music. ""Birdsongs; the language gene"" was presented in the ""Sonic Fragments"" soundart festival at Princeton University in March 2008 and in Soundlab VII in Cologne in 2010.

The piece was first presented on The Thing bbs in fall 1994, one gif a week for 14 weeks. Thing members were invited to download each image and collect the whole set. This was before the World Wide Web and before The Thing website. One day I walked into TZ'Art a gallery in Soho, the director Thomas Zollner confided in me that he had downloaded BKPC and was using it as a screen saver on his computer. I found this fact quite interesting, it indicated a new way to distribute art. The work's theme is anti-racism, anti-sexism, anti-fascism and in the spirit of Situational Art intended to challenge corporate hegemony.When the web came along I put BKPC up along with *Fire truck for Senator Exon* in a larger work called, Art Direct/ Sex, Violence & Politics I have traveled to various universities around the world and presented this work via the web. BKPC has a particular resonance among students and is invariably well received. The work created a minor uproar when Mattel inc. sent a letter to the thing accusing it of copyright dilution and demanding that the work be removed immediately.The page which Mattel objects to was featured in an article about art on the web by Robert Atkins in the December 1995 issue of Art in America. A physical object (drawing table with glassine portfolio sleeves) was shown in an artists toy show in December 1994 that was reviewed by William Zimmer in the Sunday New York Times January 1st, 1995. This work has no particular form. It is physical objects (dolls set up in vignettes), photographs, digital prints and web works. I considered this work to be totally appropriate for our global information environment.

The commonest form of this idea is that a room full of monkeys given enough time could achieve this.The second theme comes from Jorge Luis Borges's story ""The Library of Babel"" where he imagines a library that contains every book, even hypothetical books, including those made up of utter nonsense, and of course the book that contains all books. The mathematician Kurt Goeddel, in his refutation of Whitehead and Russell's thesis that it should be possible to mathematically contain everything, demonstrated that as no formal system can contain itself it is logically infinite and thus cannot contain everything. Borges uses this as the premise for his library which also, by definition, would have to be infinite.The third premise relates to another Babel story, that of the Old Testament, where the once unified human language has been destroyed and divided into innumerable other languages and dialects.The final theme is an attempt to create a form of writing where the text is always written from inside the body of the text. New words are added to a text at any point in the text, thus creating a text that expands from the inside out and is able to do so at any point in its sequence.In ""Book of Books"" all four themes are brought into play with one another at the same time. Rather than monkeys typing we have a computer program tirelessly generating random words and inserting them into the resulting ever expanding text, thus creating a text that is written from the inside out from any point in its structure. Borges's book that contains all books is also evoked as we can imagine that this system might, given an infinite period of time and processing power, generate such a book. Finally, as we watch the texts generated become smaller and smaller, the typographic structures seeking to remain fully visible on the screen, we see the unique characteristics that allow us to recognise different typographies, even different languages and scripting systems, come to resemble one another. Eventually, after a reasonable period of time (on a 1 gigaherz Mac about an hour or so), the text is reduced to a one pixel font size at which point it resembles our new universal language, binary code. All languages are thus seen to be one and the same in a demonstration of what the term convergence media might really imply, as the erasure of difference leads to the text becoming unreadable.",10/27/04 0:00,http://www.littlepig.org.uk/bookofbooks/index.htm,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/28528/,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: visual word processorDate created: 2004Date cloned: 2013-04-30",10/27/04 0:00,,,"Book of Books, Generative, HTML, language, Participatory, Shockwave, Simon Biggs, software, Text, UK, Visual"53996,Boolean Nature,Hugo,ARCIER,Hugo Arcier,"In logic and computer programming, a Boolean operator is a type of variable between two states.

The first performance took place on 26 April 2008 at 55 Leroy Street, London SE1 and was simultaneously webcast.background story:The Leroy Club was a legendary venue in the 1950's comedy circuit, where many famous comedians started out. One of these was Buddy Rivers, who returned for this benefit gig to help save the venue. He hasn't done standup for years and fears he's lost his edge, so now uses computer programs and Internet searches to generate his jokes. How will the audience react?networked performance:The core of this project is a computer network generated comedian, who is capable of an endless generated network performance. His jokes and speech are all constructed or written on the fly - live - on the Internet. For the Leroy Street performance, his behaviour was structured - along loose lines, but within definite start and end points. His performance is driven largely by user interaction and user responses, and influenced by basic artificial intelligence. In his attempt to become more ‚Äòcurrent‚Äô, Buddy tries to make his jokes more political, and his jokes are initially constructed from Yahoo searches on local social issues, such as 'gentification', and 'property developer greed' (the floor above the gallery space is occupied by a firm of property developers). This is a big move away from his traditional material, a bit like Bob Dylan going electric, and he worries how his fans will respond. As it becomes increasingly obvious the new material isn‚Äôt working - the jokes don't work- he instead tries Yahoo searches on more general subjects. As the heckling gets worse he gets increasingly irritated, and his jokes reflect his personal demons, constructed from Yahoo searches on: 'fear of failure', 'Little Britain', 'Lenny Henry', 'panic attacks', 'divorce', etc.For some years now I have experimented with new media/ online stories, particularly with networked narratives and the idea of constructing stories from web searches. One of the main aims with Buddy Rivers is to construct a character who can be unleashed/ set free and say unpredictable things. The idea of an automated stand-up comedian appeals to me. I've wrapped a story around the core, Buddy's life story and career, which I intend to build on and take further.

Along the route, a number of sound interventions are made in the city mixing oscilating tones, noises and sampled beats with the daily sound fabric of the city. All these inputs will be recorded during the drift and then in the end will be processed and combined in a final intervention of electronic music. Burro sem rabo is the name of a cart used by city dwellers and recyclers who live off the leftovers of society. Here the cart is fitted with various devices: digital recorder, sampler, synthesizers, lap-top, mobile internet connection, 30 meters of AC cord, subwoofers, drivers, tweeters and ""sample honks"" used by Brazil's informal service vans to call for clients. The cart presented in Belo Horizonte will be equipped with a GPS device. Continuing their research of immersion and urban intervention, Hapax prepares a meeting with the metropolitan public space aimed to intervene on the worn routine of home/work/leisure. With a stranger's gaze, the group will enter the heart of the city and cross ghettos, alleys, streets, faces, corners, traces and avenues. Penetrate the nervous center of the city and expand the vital powers of a planed city reinvented as music. All the coordinates of the drift will be transmitted through a GSM cellphone from the GPS device to an internet server, where they will be stored and retransmitted in real time to a computer mounted in the park, next to the Pal√°cio das Artes, running two softwares: one musical and another converting GPS data into MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) signals. The signals originating from the GPS coordinates will then modulate synthesizers and samplers. Computer, PA system and video projector will conform an audio-visual environment outside the Pal√°cio das Artes the ending point of the musical drift. In this place, the festival's audience and the general public will be able to follow the path of the artists: visually, with a line that indicates the displacement of the cart; and also on the sound dynamics generated by this same displacement. The route will gradually appear onscreen in real-time while a set of sounds chosen by the group will be automatically manipulated by the GPS coordinates of the cart. What is being played in this technology invented by Grupo Hapax? Every movement can be decomposed in several parameters as distance, curve angles, speed and so on. Likewise, sound can be decomposed: volume, tone, rhythm. Indexing the GPS coordinates we can make them correspond, transforming movement parameters in sound parameters. Hapax warns: from now on, bus drivers, walkers or the police car can be playing music. The performance will take place in Belo Horizonte, Brazil at november 17th of 2007.

Or are there only subtle shifts? The site Camouflage Comics: Dirty War Images explores both visually and verbally the ways in which the ""Process"" (or similar experiences) continues to leave imprints in the representational practices - i.e. in comics and illustrations - of the present and the past.There are roughly two sections in Camouflage Comics. First, there are the comics and illustrations made by graphic artists and scenarists. These visuals have been made especially for this project and have not been published elsewhere (with the exception of the works by Sergio Langer and Guillermo Escalante). These new works are pictorial articulations of what it means to be living in Argentina today, a country still haunted by the specter of the Proceso. At the same time however - while the country seems to be recovering from the economic collapse of 2001, Argentina is gradually bringing the issues of reconstitution and responsibility back to the public sphere, a domain once marked by institutional amnesia and amnesty. Secondly, Camouflage Comics contains essays concentrating on cartoons and comics published during the dictatorship, or during the time of transition from military rule to democracy. These analyses, although they are mainly concerned with the cultural production of a recent past, also shed light on the new comics. Indeed, the two parallel timelines cannot be clearly separated. On the contrary, they continuously intersect, urging us to interpret the 'new' in light of the 'old' - and vice versa. In addition, this site contains a discussion-blog where these subjects can be explored in full, with a view of generating new visuals/essays and insights - not specifically related to the 'case' of Argentina, but covering a large array of topics, ranging from comics, censorship, (restrained) artistic practices, human rights, the institutionalization of memory, ...",5/19/05 0:00,http://www.camouflagecomics.com/,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: counter-censorship percepticide self-censorship context  Date created: 2005-05-19",5/19/05 0:00,,,"Aarnoud Rommens, archive, censorship, contextual, death, disappearance, El Eternauta, Flash, globalization, historical, Ingrid Stojnic, interact, Internet, Jan van Ecyk Academy, marginality, Marxism and Literature, memory, Narrative, Nietzsche Genealogy History, public space, Rekall Design, resistance, responsibility, surveillance, tactical, tactical media, The Rhetoric of the Image, Visual, War"48259,Camp La Jolla Military Park,Owen,Mundy,Owen Mundy,"As a case study, I researched the historical, geographic, and economic ties between the University of California, San Diego, regional defense contractors, and the U.S. Military.

How much of ourselves is shaped by the corporations that control what we eat, wear, watch, etc.? How do corporate media, advertising, and branding function as forces of social and cultural production?  How many beliefs are the result of successful PR and advertising? Has culture given way to marketing?Corporate cultural takeover is made explicit and literal in Captured, wherein the user/viewer's identity becomes no more than an amalgamation of corporate identities - your image reconstructed by corporate images; your self remade into your corporate self.Beyond this, Captured is a result of investigations I have made into the elasticity/pliability of imagery and into the capture of real-time imagery for use in multimedia work. DJ's and electronica musicians splice, dice, and manipulate audio samples to create new reconstructed audio forms. Captured does similar things imagery, manipulating and reconstructing imagery in real time.Interactive artworks can transform the user from passive observer into active participant. I've often thought that the ultimate expression/ extension of this is to transform the user into the subject; to collapse the distance between the observer and the observed. Captured uses the viewer as subject, which extends and personalizes the meaning of the work.  It is not simply the artist (or the artist's subject) who has been captured and reconstructed by these corporate images - it is you.Process:Captured is an interactive digital media installation.  When initiated by the user, a digital camera captures an image of the viewer/user. This image (of the viewer) is then transformed and reconstructed in real time before the user/viewer's eyes. The screen begins to display a series of recognizable/popular corporate logos that flash rhythmically across the screen. The color values and saturation of the logos are manipulated according to the coloring of the captured image. As the images flash across the screen, they begin to overlay one another, forming an abstract, undulating collage of logo imagery -- a kind of digital painting using partitive color. As the images progress, building and layering upon one another, a new image begins to take form - that of the viewer. Eventually, the imagery coalesce into a portrait of the viewer, reconstructed out of corporate logo imagery. From up close, the piece looks like an abstract, fragmented collection of logo imagery.  From farther way, it is a digital painting of the viewer.  At the end of the process, the user has the opportunity to save his or her painting into memory, creating a growing library/history of images.  Users have the option/ability to browse through this history of images and see the digital paintings of others who have been captured.",7/9/03 0:00,http://karlcleveland.com/captured/,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: real timeDate created: 2003-07-09",7/9/03 0:00,,,"California, Captured, commercialization, Conceptual, corporate, Database, digital, exhibition, Flash, Generative, identity, installation, interact, Karl Cleveland, media activism, Participatory, San Diego, Shockwave, software, tactical, tactical media, US, Visual"39828,"Carl Sagan's Revenge, 2006",Colin,Goldberg,Colin Goldberg,"A short animation combining bitmap and vector techniques. STATEMENTThe connecting thread among much of my current work is that a computer was involved somehow in the creative process, either in a compositional fashion or as a compositing tool for ""handmade"" images. This rather pragmatic analysis has led me to cognify a digitality in the the work that has become a formative part of my aesthetic of some, but not all works, specifically a body of works I am calling ""Volumetric Gestures"".The visual language of these works speaks in terms of the bitmap and the vector as well as form, line, gesture, and action; the aesthetic could be called ""digitalist"" perhaps, since ""digital"" simply describes a binary transcription.After completing a series of images working with 3D wireframe chalice forms, I was introduced by art historian Andrew Hershberger to the wireframe goblets of Paolo Ucello, hand-drawn in pencil with machinelike precision by the artist in 1450. This closed a circle for me, and made me realize the circularity and connectedness of time and thought.In the incorporation of technology-based art media in my studio practice, I feel there is a new modernism which I seek; one which escapes the postmodern loop and lives in the moment, a place beyond context. Data has been aestheticised, and aesthetics have been coded; we as artists are in a position of responsibility to leave some artifacts behind. The physical and data objects which I create are documents; created equally for the self, the stranger, and the process of creation. -cag 011507",3/20/06 0:00,http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=9142046880591815448&q=colin+goldberg,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: postdigital,digitalist,audiovisual,ipod video,ipod,ipod moviesComments from user: This is a short audiovisual piece combining vector and bitmap animation, based around the artist's Volumetric Gesture series of mixed-media works on paper and canvas.Date created: 2006-03-20Comments from user: This is a short audiovisual piece combining vector and bitmap animation, based around the artist's Volumetric Gesture series of mixed-media works on paper and canvas.Date created: 2006-03-20New Keywords from user: postdigital,digitalist,audiovisual,ipod video,ipod,ipod moviesComments from user: This is a short audiovisual piece combining vector and bitmap animation, based around the artist's Volumetric Gesture series of mixed-media works on paper and canvas.Date created: 2006-03-20",3/20/06 0:00,,,"3D, Abstract, audio, Carl Sagan's Revenge, cinema, Colin Golderg, Conceptual, design, film, Formalist, media activism, Narrative, QuickTime, television, video"2904,Carnivore,Alexander,Galloway,RSG,"Carnivore is a networked art project in two parts.

In each piece, I selected a different way of masking, dividing, or combining Hofstetter's images, then I put the pieces into motion on the basis of mouse movements. Finally I added sound to each. Hofstetter's images all have to do with capital, and are all comicbook style reworkings of already existent photographic material. The paintings estrange the viewer from their content and their human subject matter, which even in their photographic form express the dominion of capital, but with whom we might otherwise feel inclined to feel at home. Hence, for the portraits of Allen Greenspan, I attempted to make the movements, sounds, and tactility cold and slippery. For the Euro Sex pieces, I tried to analyze the expanding and contracting movement of the explosive and contradictory libidinal economy which Hofstetter taps into in the racially charged imagery of those two paintings. For the paintings of the Tokyo and Kuwait stock exchanges I attempted to allude to the ghostly quality of eastern capital for those here in the west, as well as the threat of the corrupt and contradictory nature of western knowledge as regards eastern cultures, or even from one nation to another: knowledge is always brought out and cloaked by the profit motive. Similarly, for the Hong Kong stock exchange paintings, the sounds and movement of my Flash 6 projects should bring out even more the mysteries of a distopian capitalist machine that Hofstetter has coaxed out from his source material, in this case, photographs by Andreas Gursky. For his piece, ""Eins Teilt Sich In Zwei,"" I tried to follow the vertiginous impressions of the spiralling highway depicted in his diptych in terms of sound, movement, the shapes of the samples that are visible in the Flash 6 Project, and its jumpy and unpredictable responsiveness to mouse movement. Lastly, for slump and the painting of the release of the Euro, with the jagged mouse-responsiveness and the exaggerated approaching and receding motion of the paintings, I tried to bring out a sort of confused and contradictory motion of the exchanges of looking and knowing, and in turn, the power relations that structure these exchanges and are structured by them.",11/14/03 0:00,http://www.alekos-hofstetter.de,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,Date created: 2003-11-14,11/14/03 0:00,,,"Abel Neue Kunst, Abel Neue Kunst Gallery, Abstract, Alan, Alekos Hofstetter, Andreas Gursky, Animation, archive, audio, Berlin, Boris Abel, Collaborative, commercialization, corporate, Documentary, Eins Teilt Sich in Zwei, Flash, Formalist, game, Germany, homepage, Hong Kong Stock Exchange, HTML, Jason Skonieczny, Javascript, Kuwait Stock Exchange, machine, media activism, MP3, Participatory, Projects Arcade, public space, Readymade, Slump, Sophiensalle, tactical, tactical media, Tokyo Stock Exchange, Visual"22837,Catalogue:Nothingness,Kate,Armstrong,Kate Armstrong,"CATALOGUE: Nothingness is a net.art work that uses description, image, email and javascript to interrogate some of the cultural and mechanical forms that operate in online shopping.

They watch, they guide, they protect, they communicate, they transport, they predict, they look out into the stars.  In less than 100 years, the deep blue has become a complex web of machinery.Our lives are closely tied to these networks in the sky, but a disjunction has occurred between us and the aerial technologies we use every day.  We rarely consider the hulking, physical machines that have now become core to our lifestyle. By not being aware of the hardware we use, we may also not be aware of the social, economic, cultural, and political importance of these technologies. By visualizing them, it may lead to a better understanding of the forces that are shaping our future.However, our understanding of this mechanical chaos is so closely tied to the scale of it all‚Äîbeyond global‚Äîthat visualization proves limiting. Computers can now collect massive amounts of data, but our display systems are struggling to keep up.  Scale is part of information, yet we continue to reduce and enlarge everything in our increasingly well-documented world to 720x540 pixels.  Our glowing screens cannot present any of the phenomenology of the data‚Ä¶that awe that scale inspires. Planetariums give us a way to visualize a complex system without losing the emotion of the data.  Scale creates wonder, and we should not separate our feelings from the statistics‚Ä¶they help us understand them.  ‚ÄúCelestial Mechanics‚Äù is a planetarium artwork being created by Scott Hessels and Gabriel Dunne.  Instead of stars and planets, the ‚Äònight sky‚Äô program reveals many of the aerial technologies hovering, flying, and drifting above us.  The project mixes science, statistical display, and contemporary art by interpreting the mechanical patterns and behaviors of these systems as culturally significant poetics.  With help from government agencies and the science community, the artists worked with accurate tracking and protocol statistics to create 3-D models of the airborne systems. They then led a team of top animators to visualize those models in a style that reflects the chaos, force, and influence of these technologies.This short presentation offers a rare opportunity to see this complex design project as a work-in-progress.  When completed,  ‚ÄúCelestial Mechanics‚Äù will be a collage of over 40 different aerial technologies that is intended to tour planetariums internationally.

Several elements are combined to tell this story, and several media, from written narrative and physical computing to large scale community interaction and web art.It is the story about being lost in life, and about finding ways to come back from a difficult loss. I tell the story from the point of view of an explorer marooned in a hostile place, confused by his surroundings but dedicated to carving out a place for himself despite the challenges.The structure of the story is based on four main elements: EarthBase 1, is the mobile research station build to protect the explorer as he recouperates, and to be the headquarters of his research after his rehabilitation. Chief Willy Underfoot is the rescue beacon built out of the wreckage of his ill-fated craft, that he uses to contact the past in hopes of rescue. Red Toby and Scarlet O‚ÄôHara are the Exploratory Earth Rovers that he builds to explore the planet beyond his own reach, and the Hunter Gatherer mission is a mission to map his connection to the communities of Earth, and hopefully help him find a secure place within them.EarthBase 1 is a custom made nylon tent designed to evoke a scientific research station. It is the home of all other CBTSA elements, including the Earth Rovers, though they may from time to time be wandering the earth on mission.Chief Willy Underfoot is a converted Weber Grill, equipped with a GPS, Microcontroller and Webserver that allows it to serve its location to the web. The web page served displays the latitude and longitude of the beacon, and entreats viewers to visit the CBTSA at that location.Red Toby and Scarlet O'Hara are inflatable red spherical rovers one large, one smaller, equipped with several sensors that are accessible by GSM technology.  Curious explorers or visitors to EarthBase 1 can retrieve images from the rovers using their cellphones. The Hunter Gatherer Mission is an ongoing series of expeditions in which we have deployed a fleet of Exploratory Rovers into the environment surrounding EarthBase 1 to gather physical samples and photographs from the indigenous population. Each HG Rover is piloted by close friends and relations of the CBTSA into their respective communities. These pilots collect samples from their own friends and acquaintances and return them to the CBTSA. To date, more than ten missions have been launched from our facilities at EarthBase 1, yielding more than 200 samples. By this method we can create a detailed image of the societies and cultures within our reach. All of these elements woven together tell the story of someone who has lost his way, but has not given in to despair. It is intended to explore ideas of perception, about constructing realities that support our own desires and expectations rather than allowing ourselves to be constrained by constructs designed to benefit others.Our experience in life is our own to create, and our ability to do so is limited only by our will and imagination.",5/25/05 0:00,http://a.parsons.edu/~truett/thesis,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: alternate realityDate created: 2005-05-25",5/25/05 0:00,,,"art world, community, Conceptual, DHTML, Documentary, email, exhibition, Flash, historical, HTML, identity, immersion, installation, Internet, Javascript, Narrative, offline, QuickTime, Visual"9748,charlie's ants,aphid,,aphid ,"Charlie's Ants is a participatory detournement of a tract by the samename published by Chick Ministries.

The project is envisioned as an exploration into the nature of human discovery and the social behavior of collaboration/competition as exemplified by the Human Genome Project. Crossing the boundary between gallery installation and Internet art, the work is constructed around a tele-robotic agent that Internet visitors use to navigate and decode a highly complex maze designed from a human thumbprint located in the museum gallery. The online visitor becomes a hybrid cyborg sojourner through the maze -- the webcam  acting as their eyes, the robot as their legs as they transmit their agency across the Internet and into the gallery, remotely controlling the robot that navigates the maze. The project employs a mutative game structure, allowing online visitors to leave a virtual trail of media memes (video, audio, text, etc.) behind for others to read, duplicate, or delete in the search for a unique sequence that will decode the maze. The ghost of the minotaur roams the maze in the form of random mathematical algorithms that yield mutative forces to the memes in the database, frustrating attempts at an easy, linear solution.

By residing more frequently in the present moment, practitioners begin to see both inner and outer aspects of reality. Inner reality may unfold as one sees that the mind is continually chattering with commentary or judgment. By noticing that the mind is continually making commentary, one has the ability to carefully notice those thoughts, and then decide if those thoughts have value. Those practicing mindfulness realize that ""thoughts are just thoughts""; the thoughts themselves have little or no weight. One is free to release a thought (""let it go"") when one realizes that the thought may not be concrete reality or absolute truth. Thus, one is free to observe life without getting caught in the commentary. Many ""voices"" or messages may speak to one within the ""vocal"" mind. It is important to be aware that the messages one hears during ""thinking"" may not be accurate or helpful, but rather may be translations of, or departures from truth.As one more closely observes inner reality, one finds that happiness is not exclusively a quality brought about by a change in outer circumstances, but rather by realizing happiness often starts with loosening and releasing attachment to thoughts, pre-dispositions, and ""scripts""; thereby releasing ""automatic"" reactions toward pleasant and unpleasant situations or feelings.However, mindfulness does not have to be constrained to a formal meditation session. Mindfulness is an activity that can be done at any time; it does not require sitting, or even focusing on the breath, but rather is done by bringing the mind to focus on what is happening in the present moment, while simply noticing the mind's usual ""commentary"". One can be mindful of the sensations in one's feet while walking, of the sound of the wind in the trees, or the feeling of soapy water while doing dishes. One can also be mindful of the mind's commentary: ""I wish I didn't have to walk any further, I like the sound of the leaves rustling, I wish washing dishes wasn't so boring and the soap wasn't drying out my skin"", etc. Once we have noticed the mind's running commentary, we have the freedom to release those judgments: ""washing dishes: boring"" may become ""washing dishes: washing dishes"". In this example, one may see that washing does not have to be judged ""boring""; washing dishes is only a process of coordinating dishes with soap and water. Any activity done mindfully is a form of meditation, and mindfulness is possible practically all the time.",9/20/07 16:57,http://www.holos.net/rhizome/click_to_disturb/clicktodisturb.html,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,,9/20/07 16:57,,,"Aware, Flash, knowthy self, Mind, random"55615,Cloud Formations,Dina,Kelberman,Dina Kelberman,"Cloud Formations is a project that came out of the Blue Clouds project.

These ‚Äúpaintings‚Äù reference the color field paintings that emerged in the late 1950s, but in a digital format. From Carolyn Kane, Rhizome Curatorial Fellow:""Color Field Painting ('Where,' after Morris Louis) consists of a series of vertical browser windows that appear consecutively across the screen from left to right. Each browser is set to 800 pixels high, 100 pixels wide, making each window a broad stripe of color. Each stripe is filled with a different color. JavaScript is set to randomly determine which color will be loaded, but the set of possible colors is determined by the artist. The piece plays on the codification of online color in the context of art history. Morris Louis‚Äô painting ""Where"" (1960), also consists of a series of multicolored bands that run vertically on the composition, and all of Demers‚Äô color are digitally sampled from this palette. However, where Louis‚Äôs composition consists of hand-painted lines, and fluid and continuous brush strokes that gently converge at the bottom, Demers‚Äôs color bars are all formed according to the same rectangular dimensions and orientation. They are also animated in time; after all of the bars have appeared, they disappear after ten seconds, making his appropriation of the original a commentary on the grid-like structure of HTML code, and the ephemeral character of internet art.""From Eric Sanner, Juror for ""Zeros + Ones: The Digital Era"" (Featured Artist Selection):""BNM affiliate climate/gallery recently held a show of art involving digital processes. I was the juror for the show, and thought I‚Äôd use this space to clarify my approach to selecting the Featured Artists.""The first thing on my mind was 'amibition.' I‚Äôd rather see an artist take a big, bold stab at something spectacular and fall short than make something polished but ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù Beyond that, I tended to lean towards work which either struggled against old media formal constraints, or work which seemed to fondly reference the concerns of artists of past eras, in a brand-new-feeling way.""Ultimately, there was a lot to like in the show. I had a hard time limiting my selection to ten people ‚Äì there was more work which really spoke to me, many more than ten. However, when making the final decision about who to feature, I focussed on how innovative the artist‚Äôs use of technology was, weighing that above other aesthetic criteria.

I might scan in straight, long lines across tables, tie the scanner around my neck and swing over flowers, do pogo-like gestures over bricks, or just follow the wind over water lilies in a pond. The dynamism of my relationship to the landscape is transformed into beautiful and quirky renderings, which are re-stretched and colored on my laptop, then produced as archival art objects using photographic or inkjet processes. I also often take details from these images and iteratively re-make them as traditional prints: lithographs, etchings, engravings and woodcuts, among others. Compressionism follows the trajectory of Impressionist painting, through Surrealism to Postmodernism, but rather than citing crises of representation, reality or simulation, my focus is on performing all three in relation to each other. More than a little tongue-in-cheek in reference to the grandeur which history of art confers through its ‚Äòisms', Stern took to calling his creative process ‚ÄòCompressionism'.... The references that radiate from this term are numerous, and are backed up in Stern's work....To call Stern's images ‚Äòpainterly' on the strength of their swathes of colour and digitally rendered striations that recall brushstrokes is to tell only half the story. The tantalising quality of the surfaces of his works comes from the sense that they contain much that they're not readily revealing.... Stern's entire process expands to encompass fairly traditional printmaking techniques, and a great tension is established by this.... The results are compelling, an amalgamation of visual languages from two very different ends of Western Art history.... While Nude Descension (again a playful gesture to history of art) has a fluid, otherworldly quality, the print which accompanies it, Nude Descension II, accrues a salacious, lo-fi quality that adds another dimension to Stern's formal repertoire.... Jo'burg Boogie Woogie, an image that looks like a cross-section of a grim face-brick wall, is a play on high Modernist Mondrian's Broadway Boogie Woogie. But the optimism in modernity that manifested in Mondrian's confection here morphs into a snippet of urban realism ... the format surely hints at the overcrowding of downtown Jozi living spaces. The image is forbidding in the truest sense of the word, denying spatial access by enforcing the impenetrability of the picture plane. Yet Stern's technique allows for moments of slippage, vertical slashes across the format that give visual and conceptual relief from the rigidity of bricks and mortar.... Michael Smith, March 2007 ArtThrob.co.za:""The work that remained with me long after I had left the gallery space, however, was Epics and Anthologies... derived from scans of Stern's bookshelf... their spines stretched and compressed to the point of illegibility, the books become like blocks in a warped Tetris game, the layers of creative history piling up so quickly and disjointedly that one is powerless to effectively decode their meanings and implications....""<br/><br/>""Stern's performative interests expand to include ‚Äòperforming' a relationship to history, a quietly anarchic deconstruction of the creative person's position in relation to history.... [the works] reveal that Stern's is a position of productive paradox, of signalling his debt to the historical archive of creativity yet resisting the impulse to politely replicate its terms.""

The driving concepts are public catharsis and voyeurism: Members confess not only to feel the thrill of manifesting their secrets in words for others to read, but the excitement of anonymously reading the secrets of others. Because the thrill of confessing is greater when there's a chance of easily deniable discovery (similar to flirting) members will be tempted to involve their friends or secret romantic interests in the site. In this way the Confess website may become a successful meme--It will function as contagious media.  The site also illustrates decentralized control and self-government to a certain degree. Members can only read one confession from another member for each one they themselves submit. Likewise they cannot confess again until they have reviewed another member's confession. In this way a 1:1 ratio of submissions to reviews is maintained. Also, each submitted confession is only ever read by one other member, after which it is ""sealed."" Members rate each anonymous confession they read based on pre-defined criteria, such as ""believability"" or ""scandalousness."" Consequently each member gains a rating, or score, based on the average of their accumulated confessions. (Ratings are weighted differently based on their recentness and total number of ""recent"" confessions.) When a member is ready to read another's confession it is picked for them by the website based on the member's score. Members with ""good"" scores get to read ""better"" confessions. Conversely members with ""bad"" scores are forced to read ""poor"" confessions. In this way confessing becomes a game. Members encourage each other to make ""good"" confessions through decentralized policing based on shifting cultural values.  Future goals include improving the rating interface and the site's ""replay value."" What does the typical user really want? How can a member be encouraged to visit the site regularly for a month? A year? How can the site become more contagious?

The premise of the work is that blindness is a disease occurring in many forms that bear various consequences. For example, both utopian and dystopian outlooks toward technology (forms of blindness, if you will) can lead people to harmful beliefs and practices.The protagonist, Victoria, is physically blind due an arson and metaphorically blind because she refuses to ‚Äúsee‚Äù the benefits of technology and of re-discovering a long lost love; her sister, Virginia, cannot see that her marriage is crumbling because she refuses to acknowledge that her husband has an Internet love affair; Mary Meade, the assistant hired to be Tori‚Äôs eyes, cannot see that for which she has been searching - her own sisters - because she is functionally illiterate; and the mystery ‚Äúvisitor,‚Äù cannot see that his ignorance and his desire to hurt several of these people, could be his own damnation.The title, Covalent Bonds, has roots in biological science. Briefly, covalent bonds form when connected atoms have almost the same attraction for electrons. Sharing one or several pairs of electrons allows the atoms to fill their exterior shells, which produces energetic stability.  Used as metaphor, the title symbolizes familial, geographical and cultural allegiances, or those ‚Äúshells‚Äù from which individuals establish their ‚Äúenergetic stability,‚Äù their beliefs,their values. What‚Äôs more, as the story setting is in the area of Northeastern Pennsylvania known as ‚ÄúThe Coal Region,‚Äù the element carbon, which comprises 90 percent of anthracite coal, easily forms covalent bonds. Indeed carbon is an elemental building block of material in living organisms, human beings included. Location and the natural world and considerations of our connections to and interactions with it usually are involved in my thinking and in my art.Covalent Bonds also symbolizes the links within the hyperfiction, the links among orality, print, performance and digital fiction, the convergence between the sciences and the arts, and, finally, as aforementioned, to metaphorically define the sustaining life forces and connections among the characters and their social and physical places in the microcosm where the story unfolds. Where traditional elements of fiction writing are concerned, Covalent Bonds uses Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy of needs, Aristotle‚Äôs three types of drama and Lajos Egri‚Äôs three dimensions of character and employs the five main elements of fiction: characterization, conflict, plot, setting and theme, and traditional literary devices, including, but not limited to: metaphor (igniting imagination to show the relationship between individuals, terms and ideas that, at first glance, are foreign to each other), dialogue, foreshadowing, flashback, personification and symbolism.Concerns about the materiality of reading led me to design the story so that readers new to hyperfiction do not feel overwhelmed by what they see. Therefore, if a reader so chooses, Covalent Bonds can be read from beginning to end, in a linear fashion as one typically reads a book. They will miss certain lexias, sub-plots and opportunities for interactivity, but they will have a full story if they choose to read the pages without clicking on the hypertextual images and text.Covalent Bonds is a finished story in the traditional print sense. In screen space, it is far from being a closed book. It is a world wherein changes are occurring, a place inhabited by people whose interactions with others bring about change in individual and collective thought and action. Thus, I include on the ‚Äúcover‚Äù a date noting when the story was last updated.‚ÄúOh foolish writer. Now moves. Even in story time, dream time, once-upon-a-time, now isn‚Äôt then ‚Ä¶a mere glimpse at this place told me that things had been happening there while I wasn‚Äôt looking. It was high time to go back and find out what was going on now.‚Äù (Tales from Earthsea, foreword)In my view, Ursula K. LeGuin, the creator of the fictional world of Earthsea, referred to the artist‚Äôs mind at work while going about day-to-day living. Earthsea is bound in printed volumes. Yet, the people and the place had evolved since the last page was written and placed in book form.For the author/artist, then, the infinite ‚Äúpage‚Äù in hyperfiction writing and the ""canvas"" in screen space are liberating elements whereby one‚Äôs marks on the story world may be erased, enhanced and/or expanded. ",10/30/03 0:00,http://www.christinegoldbeck.com/CovalentBonds/menu1.htm,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/37617/CovalentBonds/menu1.htm,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: narrativeDate created: 2003New Keywords from user: narrativeDate created: 2003-10-30New Keywords from user: narrativeDate created: 2003-10-30New Keywords from user: narrativeDate created: 2003-10-30New Keywords from user: narrativeDate created: 2003-10-30New Keywords from user: digital divide,readingDate created: 2003-10-30Date cloned: 2013-05-08Note: adjusted hardlink in text1.swf to softlink --AD",10/30/03 0:00,,,"allegory, Anthracite Region, art world, browser, Christine Goldbeck, community, email, Flash, game, historical, HTML, identity, Internet, minecountry.com, Narrative, Pennsylvania, QuickTime, Readymade, responsibility, Shockwave, technophobia, Telematic, Text, Visual"47045,CO¬≤nscience  - Second Life,Vera,Bighetti,Vera Bighetti,"The possibility of an art that encloses the theoretical horizon, the innumerable intentions and the social context, still with an independent and private symbolic space, where aesthetic, cultural and social objects can be ranks in confrontation are the great desire of researcher in the technological art. The platform of open code in the Second Life, allows cultural and social interchanges, increases the malleability of the individuals, through the net of information that consequently will bring a change in the artistic experimentation contemporary. Bibliography:Bourriaud, Nicolas, Est√©tica relacional.

We learn to inhabit a world that follows daily pay-conceived ideas of the real world, but where new models of action now can be created by the art. Using the expression of Michel Certeau, we are lodgers of the culture, in the cultural recycling, the invention of the daily one and the organization of the time. In the Second Life, new modalities of subjectivity if create through the creative possibilities of objects, images and sounds, creative tools to invent new relations with the body, the time, the information of thoughts and behaviors. The art of today can be understood as a work process, a production way that soon that the public reaches, immediately becomes a collective of interator and creator. We affirm now , the public loses its quality of being that one that he looks at, today it starts to have a paper in the accomplishment of the workmanship, existing more space between workmanship and does not publish. We are in the time of the manipulation, the taking of decisions and in the complementation of the technological workmanship. The aura of the work of art disappears according to Walter Benjamin. We work with aesthetic a relationary one. In this environment, the concept of Mijail Bajtin, if reaffirms.

The sublimated energy of this entropy is displayed in the geography of economic marginalisation; the spaces by the railway tracks, forgotten housing estates, empty warehouses as the discarded legacy of last centuries boom.The trail of the Cracked City leads across the globe; in all the distance and cultural shifts there are unifying sets of signifiers that mark an unseen globalisation with its inevitable gravitational pull. Istanbul, Kathmandu, London, New York, Tokyo - all contain snapshots of this future city; these cityscapes are maps of textures that together create a vision of a derelict world. Cracked Cities looks to evoke something of the haphazard analogue technology of projectors where images appears to re-order themselves and the remote jumps back and forth, one, two, three images at a time. The slideshow is a form as old as photography itself, now incorporated into the digital realm with the automation of metronomic presentation and dissolves.The digital world gives us a glimpse of the possibility of an organic world of chance with the use of a random function. We become temporarily freed from the logical order; no longer able to predict what might come onto the screen next, image follows image and the audience generates narrative in their mind.An image alone conveys an abstracted sense of location, Cracked Cities relocates the image with the viewer as we hear the sounds of voices making sense of these images. A multi-layered commentary with geographically diverse accents floats over the images, triggering associations, drawing us into the subjective world of audience.",4/1/05 0:00,http://www.hidrazone.com/cracked_cities.html,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: psychogeography, photography, slideshow, drifting, urban, dystopiaDate created: 2005-04-01",4/1/05 0:00,,,"colonialism, community, Conceptual, Database, digital, Flash, Generative, globalization, HTML, Istanbul, Julian Konczak, Kathmandu, London, Narrative, netart, New York City, public space, Third World, Tokyo, video, Virtual, Visual"27176,crc/cw,Christian,Oyarzun,Christian Oyarzun,"Given two volumes v[i] and v[j] belonging to v[] and excluding to each other.crc/cw is a device that consist of in a physical installation and document published in the internet, introduced as a prototype of possible artwork, from the local context to a global expansion one or, more specifficaly, as a neighborhood one.crc/cw is an artwork proposal based and conditioned by an investigation about the procedures that would give it  specificity to the relationship between art and digital technologies, inscribed under the protection of the question by the pertinence of the progressive insertion of technology in the context of the local production, peripherical to the global centers of technological development.crc/cw is a technological bounding object consisting of 4 units:-an input unit: 8 infrared movement sensors distributed in v[i] which ones we obtains a representation of one byte corresponding to the circulation of the exhibition space.-a process unit: a digitalization device and a data representation device, consisting of a system of autonomous temporal, graphics and sound cycles/pattern, that undergoes alterations in their diplay deppending on the excitability/irritability of the system.-an audiovisual output/display unit: located in v[j] is a non-instantiable device of spatialization/representation that works as an spatial proyection of v[i] in v[j].-a registry unit: as crc/cw only make registries in RAM, it will be only had the access to its own diagram like registry.crc/cw operates like a feedback control system (as a circuit or servomechanism), that is, as an enclosed retroaction system that keeps a relative stability in view of external or internal disturbances. crc/cw is then conceived as an implicitly virtual prototype -meanwhile it exists in its own diagram-, and which develope stars from the articulation of elements and precarious operations respect to the paradigm defined by the use of new technologies, being presented as an speculation process about the noise/takeOff produced by the feedback of physical systems and digital systems, as a possible field for sense construction.",8/12/04 0:00,http://www.error404.cl/crc_cw,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/27176/crc_cw/,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"Date created: 2004-08-12Date cloned: 2013-04-17",8/12/04 0:00,,,"Abstract, audio, Conceptual, Generative, globalization, HTML, installation, interface, language, machine, offline, Shockwave, software, surveillance, Third World, Visual"22584,create/remove,Rich,White,rich white,"The second real-time online digital/net.art residency at www.furtherstudio.org.Resident artist - Rich White.For the Furtherstudio residency Rich is creating two parallel bodies of work under the headings 'create' and 'remove'.In 'Create' Rich is exploring the theoretical, conceptual and practical possibilities of creating an 'original' net/software artwork - that is, a work that remains unique in a digital environment.'RemoveÔøΩ concerns censoring art available on the net.

The technology is an electronic device that receives distressed cricket chirps and translates the sound into a firing signal for anti-logger missiles.  The device is a form of extreme bioengineering that simply recombines consumer surveillance products (essentially ‚Äúbugging‚Äù devices) with model rockets - both trickle-down goods from the military-industrial complex.  Installation of CADS takes place along logging roads at the border between logged areas and old-growth, redwood forests currently threatened by illegal logging.  Crickets are the ideal guardians of this area since they naturally take up the perimeter and have evolved to transmit a very precise frequency should they feel threatened by the encroachment of an invasive species.  To avoid a misfire, the system is activated only when a significant number of the cricket population voice their consternation over a relatively broad area.  By technologically augmenting the natural responses of crickets, the success of CADS relies not only on interspecies collaboration but also on the collective efforts of a greatly disempowered community.  This relationship is further highlighted in a public lecture/demonstration in which attendees from various disciplines (art, engineering, biology, environmental science, etc) gather to form an academic ecosystem.  The CADS presentation explores cricket morphology, surveillance technology, and the political ecology of forestry before culminating in a cricket-assisted demonstration launch.  Afterwards, the ensuing Q & A consistently encourages a lively discussion that engages militaristic rhetoric, political obfuscation, and the polemics of ‚Äúviolence‚Äù along with notions of creative resistance and interdisciplinary social practices.",10/31/00 0:00,http://tacticalmagic.org/CTM/project%20pages/CADS.htm,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/31813/project_pages/CADS.htm,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: activism, inter-species, military, reverse engineeringDate created: 2000-10-31Date cloned: 2013-04-24",10/31/00 0:00,,,"bio, Center for Tactical Magic, Collaborative, collider, contextual, Cricket-Activated Defense System, Event, HTML, installation, nature, Northern California old-growth redwood forests, performance, resistance, security, surveillance, tactical, tactical media, utopia, War"3272,crossroads,oriol,espinal,oriol espinal,"I began Crossroads in 2000 with the purpose of create a world shaped with different virtual crossroads that allow its explorers to go to new crossroads that in turn lead to new crossroads, etc. This net-art work does not want to have a classical timeline, since the traveller may choose both the beginning and the end.

My interest in using the computer as an artistic conveyance isa calculated one in my interdisciplinary strategy.  The computer is ameta-medium which has permeated Western life because of its ability toconvey various genres of information to the user.  These varied genres ofsound, text, images, and motion pictures, were formerly separate anddistinct and this is why the computer as artistic device must be defined asa meta-medium.        Recently, some of the most important dialog around computers asmeta-medium concerned the computer as a device which offers the user achoice.  That is, the computer was seen foremost as an interactive media.If this is so, new genre artworks cannot be viewed as a conveyance forpassive consumption.  The impact of interactivity on narrative structure(now determined by the user and author in collaboration with the machine)is one of the most interesting facets of my research.        Issues relating to theory and aesthetics in computer art need to bere-examined and restated in the context of the rapid digital transformationthat has been taking place over the past few years.  This means that newdefinitions need to be attempted.        While the critical and theoretical arguments for and against thedeath of the author have proliferated since Barthes' seminal 1968 essay,""The Death of the Author,"" no conclusions have been reached.  My researchand creative manufacture remains, like that of a scientist, based upon andbranching from a pre-existing base of information.  As scientistsappropriate the theories and findings of other scientists I appropriatefrom computer culture, critical theory, and academic discourse.  If thisdefines a lack of authorship then we must re-examine the nature of science,literature, art, and all cultural achievements.        The theory which drives much of my research allows theobserver/visitor/user/patron to contribute and interact.  This creates aprofound change in both the meaning and construction of narrative in worksof art and liberates the work of art from both a singular interpretation byart critics and by the artist as the terminal creative voice.  My theoriesare based in the use of chance operations by the early twentieth centuryavant-garde yet, are tempered and directed by both free choice and theillusion of free choice.        My research has advanced the preceding theories by exploitingdistributed computing environments such the Internet.  The Internet'sconceptual origins as a network for the sharing of information, and theopening of that space from the scientific and military user to the publicpermits a fluidity of exchange between user and creator which definesavant-garde endeavor.  Historically, all new media such as photography,film, and sound recording, the avant-garde artist develops new metaphorsand methodologies for the media before the media is standardized andabsorbed by commercial culture.31 March 1998http://www.walkerart.org/gallery9/beyondinterface/hutton_artist.html cyber*babes is an early interactive hypertext piece (1996) that address the Telecommunications Act of 1996.

Carl Gustav Jung‚Äôs theory of the collective unconscious and synchronicity, and the discoveries on binary arithmetic by Leibniz are indeed ideas that have assisted me in understanding the rationality of fortune-telling, and the way of finding patterns within the Internet.There is an interesting contradiction between fortune-telling and the Internet: firstly, fortune-telling is considered a traditional analog transmitter/medium, while the Internet is built based on advanced hi-tech digital logic. Secondly, fortune-telling deals with the actual social life of individuals, while by contrast, the Internet creates a virtual life for avatar beings. Furthermore, fortune-telling is particularly focused on subjective identity whereas the Internet recognizes codes and IP addresses from each computer rather than users. Although originating from ancient times, fortune-telling is a behaviour that is still actively performed within modern hi-tech society.

No hours of torturous labor, no deep emotional expression, just a simple discovery and out it pops. What did Cory Arcangel do in this piece? Next to nothing. The computer did the work, and he just gave it a form. His discovery was this: take a huge data file--in this case his computer's memory file--and fool Quicktime into thinking it's a video file. Then press play. Your computer's memory is now video art. Quicktime plays right through, not knowing that the squiggles and shards on the screen are actually the bits and bytes of the computer's own brain. The data was always right in front of your nose. Now you can watch it.In college Cory used to slip into the public computer clusters, saddle up to a machine and pull what's called a ""core dump."" In every computer's memory there are countless pieces of left-over information just sitting there waiting for their turn to vanish as new memory is allocated. The email you just wrote is there, so is that Word file that was on your screen an hour ago. The binary data from Photoshop that you left running in the background is there too. A core dump simply writes all that data into a file and saves it on the hard drive. A born hacker, Cory would sift through this tangle of undifferentiated code, line by line, looking for interesting morsels. Maybe he would find a forgotten love letter here and there, maybe someone's term paper, or maybe just nothing. But it was always a rewarding hunt. For this piece, Cory has simply taken his hacker mentality one step further and converted the hidden world of computer memory into the time-based medium of video.Data conversions are part of computer art. This is the crux (and also the crutch) of RSG's ""Carnivore"" project. Dictionary words are converted into three dimensional spaces in Marek Walczak and Martin Wattenberg's ""The Apartment."" Mark Napier did pure data conversion with ""Feed."" What sets Cory's RAM videos apart is that they don't pretend to hinge on the craftiness of the conversion. Conversion is not what they are about. The conversions here are incidental, a trivial detail coming ages before the real fun takes place. And because of this, he eschews the A-to-B instrumentalism of these other conversion-based works.Lots of artists talk about memory. But for artists working with computers, memory has a very specific technical definition. If ever computers had a subconscious, this is it. Cory describes it as ""watching your computer suffocate and yell at the same time."" They look like digital dreams--the pure shapes and tones of real computer memory. Each video documents a new day, and each day the computer offers us a new set of memories.But the greatest thing about Cory's net art is that he's not a net artist. He never was and never will be. If net art was cinema, then Jodi would be Godard--fresh, formalist and punk-rock to the core. Entropy8zuper! would be Tarkovsky--lush, magical and complex. Etoy would be Verhoeven--hyper modern, sexy and a tad fascistic. And this leaves Cory, playing in the rec room with his Pixelvision camcorder--all dirt-style, geekcore, and what we like.--Galloway/RSG",1/1/03 0:00,http://www.turbulence.org/Works/arcangel,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: hackComments from user: Data Diaries is a 2002 commission of New Radio and Performing Arts, Inc., (aka Ether-Ore)for its Turbulence website.

Passing are the days when a scientist would measure skeletal elements with calipers, in its place are digital tools that happen to capture not only the gestural path of the researchers process, but also the shape of the specimen in three-dimensions. This process is akin to the scientist invisibly drawing the specimen and is indicative of the seldomly represented gestural process of science.

The graffiti-style result of the shadow is a representation of the scientist's hand through the eyes of the artist.Morphometrics is the measure of shape. Most commonly it is employed to describe the shape of biological organisms. Modern morphometric analysis is carried out via anatomical landmark location and recording by the biologist using a stylus-style apparatus that notes the cartesian coordinate of a point to a computer. These three-dimensional points are stored in a spreadsheet or database and statistical operations are performed on them to analyze the shape. A suite of small scripts were written to import, analyze, and visualize this data in Autodesk Maya. Animation software such as this is not commonly used in the biological sciences but through the process of creating this series of work a tool set for geometric morphometric analysis was developed. For this piece, a procedural curve is drawn through the imported point cloud, following the path of the scientists hand in the collection process.

Featuring a deluge of images (25 per second) and sounds - the viewer is invited to insert a pause, a moment of respite to process / ponder these. The notion of the pause could be characterized as a reaction to our impotence in the face of an overabundance of information existing this increasingly media-saturated world. This sense of immediacy and intimacy with supplemental realities - scattered across time zones and geographies - propels us towards various antithetic actions both in the negative (lethargy, disavowal, distancing or disillusionment) and the positive (contemplation, consideration, archiving and discovery). Martin Heidegger, questioning the reality of hyper-connectivity long before the evanescence of networked technologies, notes: ‚ÄúWhen the farthest corner of the globe has been conquered technologically and can be exploited economically;‚Ä¶when you can simultaneously ‚Äúexperience‚Äù an assassination attempt against a king in France and a symphony concert in Tokyo; when time is nothing but speed, instantaneity, and simultaneity[;]‚Ä¶there still looms like a specter over all this uproar the question: what for? - where to?

Cette id√©e de ¬´pause¬ª pourrait √™tre per√ßue comme l‚Äôexpression de notre impuissance face √† la surabondance d‚Äôinformations qui peuplent le monde de plus en plus satur√© par les m√©dias. Cette sensation d‚Äôimm√©diatet√© et d‚Äôintimit√© avec des r√©alit√©s provenant de lieux g√©ographiques et de fuseaux horaires diff√©rents provoque en nous des attitudes contradictoires, tant n√©gatives (l√©thargie, d√©saveu, distance ou d√©sillusion) que positives (contemplation, consid√©ration, archivage et d√©couverte). Bien avant l‚Äôapparition des technologies de r√©seau √©ph√©m√®res, Martin Heidegger s‚Äôest interrog√© sur la pertinence de cette ¬´hyper-connectivit√©¬ª.

At that time the web was often described as an enormous digital library that you could visit or contribute to by building a homepage. The early citizens of the net (or netizens) took their netizenship serious, and built homepages about themselves and subjects they were experts in. These pioneers found their brave new world at Geocities, a free webhosting provider that was modelled after a city and where you could get a free ""piece of land"" to build your digital home in a certain neighbourhood based on the subject of your homepage. Heartland was ‚Äì as a neigbourhood for all things rural ‚Äì by far the largest, but there were neighbourhoods for fashion, arts and far east related topics to name just a few. Around the turn of the century, Geocities had tens of millions of ""homesteaders"" as the digital tennants were called and was bought by Yahoo! for three and a half billion dollars. Ten years later in 2009, as other metaphors of the internet (such as the social network) had taken over, and the homesteaders had left their properties vacant after migrating to Facebook, Geocities was shutdown and deleted. In an heroic effort to preserve 10 years of collaborative work by 35 million people, the Archive Team made a backup of the site just before it shut down. The resulting 650 Gigabyte bittorrent file is the digital Pompeii that is the subject of an interactive excavation that allows you to wander through an episode of recent online history. The installation is an interactive visualisation of the 650 gigabyte Geocities backup made by the Archive Team on October 27, 2009. It depicts the file system as a city map, spatially arranging the different neighbourhoods and individual lots based on the number of files they contain. In full view, the map is a datavisualisation showing the relative sizes of the different neighbourhoods.

However, in a gallery setting it can take on other meanings, ""such as the viral nature of memes, and the capacity of visual art to transmit memes. Furthermore, it suggests the notion that an art institution can be so ineffective, so wholly devoted to the obsolete, that one would need a special high-tech detector to tell if anything serious or substantial is going on there.""Bill Gusky, ArtblogcommentsThis piece shows the occurrence of airborne Rhinovirus (common cold) particles in the gallery environment. It visualizes what would be live data from advanced sensors capable of detecting airborne viruses. The spectator is confronted with the idea that they are being registered not by what they say or do, but by what they involuntarily carry in their bodies.These devices register and feed data to the database to create, in real time, a relationship between the number of visitors and the amount of viruses that are visualized on the screen. These types of counting devices are typically used to calculate transaction/traffic = conversion ratios that are most commonly used for improving selling and merchandising.

Periodically, the rings converge to form pictures of birds in flight. Diagram of the Dynamics of the Physical Embodiment of Desire is a custom software piece written in C++, utilizing OpenGL. A traditional sculpture plinth houses both projector and computer, projecting the piece onto the wall. There are over 50 drawings of birds which may be formed, though, because the work is generative, every second is unique. Mankind has always defined ""self"" in relation to both the natural and the manufactured world around us. Increasingly, we see nature and technology merging in unprecedented ways; from the robotic and digital pets available in toy stores to the convincingly simulated animals and plants in movies. I am interested in the personal experiences and emotions motivated by this overlap of nature and technology. In my work, I create these moments in several different ways. In one form, I take a naturally occurring phenomenon, like the flight pattern of birds, or the way water drops roll down a window pane, and first use computer algorithms to create a digital imitation of it. Once I have achieved a realistic simulation, I manipulate these algorithms, modifying the phenomenon to create a magical or surreal experience. I also take a more sculptural approach, using inanimate objects to make creatures with needs and demands. I add robotic elements to both repurposed and handmade objects, giving them voices and personalities. Through tactile and audio interactions with the objects, users develop immediate emotional bonds which can take many forms, such as tenderness, repulsion and joy. In a third manner, I use existing and customized video editing software to deconstruct theatrical elements of cinema, such as time and choreography, to create allegorical new works with a painterly and a poetic sensibility. These pieces often begin with existing popular films and, while retaining clues as to their identity, isolate and emphasize one or more formal filmic element by using it as an artistic tool. I also use my own footage and create looped video narratives that address such issues as creation, faith, and doubt. In each form, my work addresses the way people perceive and relate to their surrounding world and the myriad images populating the contemporary landscape. By taming and redefining natural phenomenon through programming, projection and imbuing inanimate objects with human characteristics, my work aims to create transcendent experiences that make viewers more aware of their mutable surroundings.

The effect would be similar to walking through a Sol LeWitt geometric architectural sculpture.The participants navigate through their own completely software generated 3D architectural maze/game space interactively in real-time according to the laws of symmetry. Every line drawn has it's polar opposite or mirror image that results in the creation of a three dimensional symmetrical virtual sculptural form. The participant selects a geometric maze form (circle, triangle or square) that functions both like a video game space (the form can be navigated and the maze solved) and as an architectural virtual geometric sculptural form. As the paths of an individual form are transversed they would be illuminated by uniquely colored light, fog and various atmospheric effects created by particle physics algorithms and behaviors in AfterEffects software.Simple minimalist structures like cubes will be used like building blocks to create more sophisticated digital prototypes in Maya 3D modeling software and Adobe CS6 (Photoshop, AfterEffects, Illustrator). A game engine such as Unity will be incorporated in order to transverse and solve each sculptural virtual maze. ‚ÄúDigital Maze Symmetry Project‚Äù was presented at the ""Virtual Public Art Project"" at the Philadelphia Festival for the Arts (adapted for the ""Layar"" 3D cell phone application), the Archetime Conference on the scientific, artistic and academic aspects of time ( which culminated in ‚ÄúInfinite Instances‚Äù published by Radom House).

In this installation five dynamic animations fill the walls of the gallery space. Four of these animations are looping DVD projections that depict anonymous individuals moving through a series of public spaces, unaware of their surroundings because they are intent on their cell-phone conversation. At the bottom of each projection are fragments of text that represent the monologue one would hear if one was within earshot of the person talking on the phone. The texts from the four projections intersect physically as the viewer reads across them. The fifth projection is connected to a computer and contains the interactive component of the installation. Visitors to the space trigger a series of sounds by interacting with 'toy' cell-phones that hang from the ceiling of the gallery. When visitors enter they can pick up one of the ten phones and press on any of its buttons. All the buttons are programmed to trigger an event on the wall. When the installation is inactive one sees a series of small icons randomly moving around the wall. Using the 'toy' phones causes the icons to grow from their diminutive silent state to a larger brighter version with sound. The voices reflect the global nature of cell phone usage as the conversations take place in numerous languages: French, Spanish, Japanese, Indonesian, Cantonese, as well as English. When all ten phones are active the experience is a sound collage, a cacophony of overlapping icons and voices. ",5/1/04 0:00,http://www.jodyzellen.com/dvx_index.html,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/29951/dvx_index.html,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: installation Date created: 2004-05-01Date cloned: 2013-05-08Note: this could probably be combined with other DV entry --AD",5/1/04 0:00,,,"audio, community, Conceptual, Flash, Formalist, HTML, installation, interface, language, Narrative, public space"47214,Disperse.

Does this distinction, in fact, matter? And wherein lies consequence?In Do you want love or lust?, Claude Closky's seemingly endless sets of questions, all culled from recent popular magazines, relentlessly interrogate the reader's tastes, habits, proclivities, and preferences. But by endlessly deferring a final or culminating question, he preempts the anticipated tallying, crystallization, and definitive determination: the implications and consequences of one's responses to this farrago of options cannot be systematized into fixed or conclusive interpretation. Closky's anomalous twist to the familiar pop-psychological quiz privileges the act of choosing, for every answer is followed by another apparently randomly generated question. Nonetheless, it is impossible to retrace one's steps, to reconsider one's preferences: serendipity constantly intervenes with alternative options, precluding the creation of meaningful sequences, and with it the building of telling results. When frustration wells up, the only option is to quit, yet in doing so the temptation to dismiss the whole enterprise as meaningless, as a pointless game, a mere jest, never quite carries conviction. For, by hesitating, deliberating, and pondering one has already invested time, activated desire, and flirted with the possibility of revelation...Playful and ludic, Closky's works are free of any moralistic undertones. And never can his reticent, disinterested stance be described as coolly deconstructive. Typically, as in Do you want love or lust?, whatever semiotic and sociological implications might be drawn from this vacuous if harmlessly engaging pastime are left unstressed, as it is the perogative of the player rather than the artist, in his view, to confront any larger meanings that might be drawn from this experience. ""I think what feeds my work are really small experiences in and out of the studio,"" he recently stated. ""Everyday encounters stimulate me. The reflex is important.... Sometimes it is as if the piece already existed in the material I am using, so that all I have to do is to isolate a section ... and look at it from a different angle. And that new point of view comes from my immediate reaction to my everyday life.""Closky's early works played with that seemingly irresistible desire to construct taxonomic systems, and with the equally ubiquitous wish to identify order to any apparently inchoate or amorphous entity -- or, with its converse, an instinctive compulsion to disrupt the systematic by taking it to its logical if absurd conclusion. Beginning with lists and abstract typologies, he tested what are purported to be universal systems, most notably, the alphabetical, chronological, and numerical.In one book, for example, he listed in alphabetical order the first one thousand numbers; in another, Osez, he amassed thousands of injunctions from advertising arranged by pace, going from long suggestions to quick, brief imperatives, beginning with ""Apprenez a faire deux choses a la fois..."" (Learn to do two things at once...) and concluding with ""Osez"" (Dare), the shortest commandment he happened upon in his characteristically informal method of searching, random sampling. 200 Mouths to Feed, a video compiled from short extracts from television commercials features a miscellany of people eating, a natural gesture which here becomes bizarre and artificial through repetition. And 100 photographs which are not photographs of horses is a short breviary comprised of images of hens. Whether in the form of cheaply printed books, unlimited editions of single-channel videos, posters or wallpaper, multiples are Closky's preferred vehicles. Given its demotic range, ready availability, and relatively low-cost production, the World Wide Web has become for this young French artist, an equally appealing medium in which to work.The graceful deprecatory wit that informs much of his art places it in a lineage that stems as much from Marcel Broodthaers and Ed Ruscha as from Minimal and Conceptual art, from which it also derives certain strategies and stylistic influences. Unlike those predecessors such as the Situationists who maintained a strict distance from their subjects of inquiry, Closky and his generation immerse themselves. Thus, he savors the pleasures of flirtation, the titillations of desire and libidinal excess without finally succumbing, without being wholly seduced. Crucial to the suspenseful balance he maintains is the undergirding of his disarming bravura and wit with a rigorous methodological stringency, and a critical, if laconic, acuity. This, together with the subtly deranged playfulness that stems from his engaging affection for the absurdity of life, its mundane values and ideals, has resulted in a body of work at once singular and unmistakably his. This project was commissioned by Dia Center for the Arts. Minutia and miscellany abound in this online question session.

Using motion capture, web tools, animation, games engines, sound and movement dotdotdot presents a series of animated interactive vignettes. These can be manipulated in terms of speed, sound, rotation  and movement so that the basis of the range of visuals on offer stays the  same but also so that the viewer/player can change them to accommodate their own preferences. Each work has an Igloo signature but it allows the viewer to manipulate, play and be creative - after years of artists striving for truly interactive work, dotdotdot knowingly works with the limitations of interactivity in order to give the piece a characteristic style,<BR><BR>The viewer/player is presented with a range of choices involving genre orientated radio stations (you can choose drum & bass through to  chart music) and a variety of visuals such as red, dot, bendy and plane. All  these permutations and combinations together with the ability to interact  with the animated figures in terms of speed and rotation challenge the viewer to think about the visual and audio styles in relation to their own  experience of video, sound, animation and movement drawn from a variety of sources in day to day culture.<BR><BR>The project, which has been ongoing, is the product of Ruth Gibson, a  dancer who is specifically looking at development of movement in the context  of motion capture, and a programmer Bruno Martelli, who is interested in pushing the limits of technology in real physical contexts. The artists draw in expertise and collaborators as and when they need and the quality of the work is enhanced with every reworking. Their animations reflect these concerns with their 3D quality combined with recognisability of the human form in spite of the abstractness of the animated shape.‚Äù<BR><BR>Helen Sloan,  Director - SCAN<BR><BR> ‚ÄúThe physical and the virtual meet most agreeably in dotdotdot. A landscape from beyond the edges of the browser window that gives glimpses of unseen places. dotdotdot is constructed using several different motion capture systems and improvised performances creating abstract digital portraits.

The brainchild of Igloo - aka Bruno Martelli and Ruth Gibson - dotdotdot physically resides on two laptops hooked up to plasma screens.<BR><BR>dotdotdot‚Äôs accessibility belies its underlying complexity. At its heart is movement data, motion-captured from six dancers. Launch the program - having chosen one of six dancing forms - and you are presented with a dancing figure with which you can interact. Visually, the figures come in a variety of forms: from collections of dots which mirror the raw motion-capture data, via a figure that looks like it was constructed from pipecleaners to a figure constructed from typography. Instantly, you grasp the possibilities offered by motion-capture. Each dancing figure can be rotated and repositioned using the mouse (they all respond to mouse input in subtly different ways), panned and zoomed in and out. Extra visual effects can be applied to many of them, such as the addition of trails. The overall effect is fascinating and certainly leads to musings about the body and technology: however inorganic the figures look, they move in a human manner. The ability to rotate can create interesting visual effects - it is possible, with some of the dancing figures, to create the illusion that you are looking up at them from underneath the dancefloor, for example. Gibson‚Äôs choreography for the motion-captured dancers took in several styles of dance, including contact improvisation: Gibson explains that one dancer wore sensors while their partner did not - creating the effect of an invisible presence. <BR><BR>Martelli, meanwhile explains the complexity of the installation: five software packages were used to get from mocap data to end-product - namely Hypervision, Filmbox, Maya, Director and Shockwave.

Using icons, signs, words, sounds, and symbols Dream7 creates sense impressions that attempt to communicate with the viewer on an almost unconscious level.  Dream7's pre-cognitive pieces are not random noise.  The narrative slices/trajectories and the vague pictorial objects are purposefully assembled as to evoke a sense impressionistic response.  Using Jungian symbolism, tones, themes, metaphor, and characterization the site attempts to lead the viewer in certain narrative directions, and then right before the coalescence of meaning, aborts, and drops them in an in-between space that they then can fill with their own liminal reactions, circling in a vague precognitive state.The goal in all this is to create an environment of commonality between the artist and the viewer.  The belief being that in the pre-cognitive state people are more able to reach a level of true empathy.  The precognitive state being the place which exists before the constructs of individual personality are raised, so in a sense it is the place were people share the most in common, and may be able to reach a level of greater core understanding.  Or to put it more succinctly, in dreams we know each other.Dream7 uses the medium of the web because on one level the web is a metaphor for the brain, and even, the collective unconscious:  A networked terrain of text thoughts and bit impressions.

Once caught the infected have a repeating dream, and as the virus progresses the dream frequency increases until the sick go insane, lapse into a coma, or starve. This project represents a psychiatrists attempt to cure the virus by comparing the dreams themselves. The dreams are represented by online books, which not only act as a portal to the text of the dreams, but also link to other realsm of science, biology and the surreal. And while the project is seemingly simple in its design, each of the books links to a wider and strange dream world. Certainly an odd mix of biology, superstition and fiction, all bundled in an interactive mix.There does not seem to be a clear method of transmission. Some seem to immediately gather the virus‚Äôs drifting eyes after even the briefest contact with an infected patient. And in divergent cases, the spouses or children of patients, after extensive exposure, the exchange of saliva or even contact with blood or semen, do not appear to have any symptoms of the virus. Without understanding the infection vehicles or the biological conditions within in which infection occurs, we are cannot begin to stop the viruses spread. Of course isolating cases could be effective. But with such mild symptoms in the initial stages, there is no clear way of detecting the viruses presence. How do we convince the public to remember their dreams? Currently the only measurable symptoms are the increasing occurrence of a singular dream. In the first stages of the virus, the dream will repeat itself once or twice a week. Then as the virus occupies more of the bodies neuropathway, the dream will repeat nightly. While this might not seem problematic for most patients, and in fact be quite a novelty, once this stage is reached the virus is eventually fatal. The timeline of death can vary widely, but typically takes from three to four months from the patient‚Äôs first infection. Stages of the virus:Week One:   First instance of the dream. Usually followed by one or two more occurrences a few days later.Week Two: Some patients recognize similarities between dreams, but very few classify the dreams as copies. Dreams will occur with greater frequency. By the end of this stage usually nightly.Week Three:  Some patients begin to experience sleep loss or agitation. However those symptoms are still too mild for most to seek medical assistance. The dreams occur nightly, but because few people remember their dreams, any connections between dreams are largely ignored.Week Four:  Tiredness, agitation, moodiness are usually serious enough for the patients to seek some remedy. Also the dreams begin to occur many times a night. Might patients begin to identify the resemblances and voice their concerns to others.Week Five-Seven: By the end of this period the dreams have drifted into waking times. Due to these waking dreams there is serious impairment to the operation of motor vehicles or other potentially dangerous activity. Much like a seizure, these waking dreams will cause the patient to lose consciousness for a few minutes.  During this stage some patients die from injuries as a result of car crashes, falling, gun accidents or other mishaps. Most patients consult psychological help as it becomes obvious that they are having the duplicating dreams. Week Eight-Nine:  By this stage patients in almost all cases have been severely affected.

Inspired by the Chladni's famous sand figures visualizing sound waves in solid materials, Kundt devised an experiment for visualizing longitudinal sound waves through fine lycopodium dust; a setup that would allow him to measure the speed of sound in different gases.Kundt was a strong believer in experimental methods over purely theoretical inquiry in a time when the disciplines of theoretical and experimental physics started to diverge.'Dust Serenade' intends to remind us the materiality of sound. Tubes filled with scraps of words and letters--cut-up theory--interact with sound waves and turn into figures of dust. Here, visitors can modulate the frequency of the sound emitted by moving a rod and create different harmonic sound effects. As sound waves figure, refigure, and disfigure the text, we invite visitors to rethink about the tension between their theorical knowlegde and the sensory experience.Dust Serenade is part of a series of interactive sound projects that enable visitors to experience the physical aspects of sound, presence, and atmosphere.

In public environments, individuals interact by means of a variety of bodily and auditory cues and gestures. These ambient communication techniques can be directed at specific individuals or may be general expressions of mood meant for anyone who happens to notice. Visitors to public spaces, such as a caf√©, seek the passive awareness of others to achieve a sense of connectedness born of shared experience, like the audience in a music venue. This project highlights the exhibitionism and voyeurism in the public sphere by amplifying participants' moods via music and increasing shared experiences to encourage deeper interaction. It aims to develop an environment which increases audience interaction and connectedness in a localized, computer-controlled performance.The system is a client-server architecture made of three components: (1) an audio preparation interface, (2) an interactive performance interface, and (3) a machine learning-based conductor.  Musician's have contributed files to represent participants' moods.  Participants input their mood during the performance.  An artificial conductor mixes an acoustic ecology based on mood data.  Participants are encouraged to respond to whether the audio represents the mood they've input.

Echelon is the automated surveillance system employed by the US, UK, Australia and other allies to snoop on global electronic communications. This net-based artwork employs words and terms stored in the Echelon system in a program that automatically generates novel texts from them.Whenever a user moves their mouse over the text in the top left corner it will automatically re-write itself as a new text. It will then e-mail that text to a random e-mail address (this last e-mailing component of the work is currently disabled, but will be enabled by the artist at the appropriate time - the effect will be to flood the net with echelon sensitive messages at the rate of hundreds per minute, depending on user interaction). Many other auto-authored Echelon based texts are also written to the screen at the same time.Echelon is reportedly capable of intercepting large portions of the world's communications, including phone conversations, email and SMS. It uses dictionaries to search for keywords that various security services consider to be of interest. Under the Echelon system a particular station's dictionary computer contains not only its parent agency's chosen keywords, but also a list for each of the other four agencies. Each station collects all the telephone calls, faxes, telexes, emails, internet traffic and other communications that pass through it and compares them against this list of keywords.This artwork uses similar grammar software to that used in The Great Wall of China, by the same artist.All code, data and other material used in Echelon were authored by Simon Biggs (except the words).

The resulting grid is being generated in real-time, with the top-left square representing the most recent post. The remaining squares are presented left-to-right, top-down in reverse chronological order. A viewer can actively change the composition of the grid by simply changing the size of the browser window. Rows and columns can be added or removed, causing the individual squares to shift and/or wrap, thus creating a new composition. While the actual content of the tweet is not shown, the author, time, and date of the post can be viewed by placing your cursor over any given square.This piece was always conceptualized to be a color grid, but it wasn‚Äôt until I started Photoshopping mockups that I thought of Ellsworth Kelly and, specifically, his grid pieces (such as ""Colors for a Large Wall"").

Kelly‚Äôs color square pieces are arranged in an arbitrary sequence, whereas this piece is a direct chronological representation of my Twitter feed. While unpredictable, it is certainly not arbitrary.

Its participants enter through black and red velvet curtains - a literalized performance space - and into a white interaction area approximately 8 meters long; the width at the entrance begins the size of a doorway and expands to that of a large projection screen.Upon entering, viewer-participants meet with an almost real-time abstraction of themselves - an outline drawn with large black dots; the closer they are to the screen/camera, the larger their image becomes. hektor‚Äôs thoughts (in the form of text) float around them, in animated sequence. With this exterior re-presentation of their bodies, viewers-turned-performers can grab and trigger hektor‚Äôs text; each word that a viewer‚Äôs outline touches will stop, turn red, and recite a line of poetry. enter:hektor asks viewers to ‚Äúleave behind‚Äù their everyday performances of self, and attempts to accent each step and movement as a rich, performative gesture.The enter software does not work as one would suspect, and pushes viewers to act in ways they normally wouldn‚Äôt. Rather than traditional body-tracking software, the code is written in such a way that only the outermost points on the horizontal axis are shown - for example, if you put your arms up in a V, your head disappears. The piece was originally exhibited on an old 8500 Macintosh (2000), which ran relatively slowly; in the updated version (2005), I‚Äôve imitated this minor lag. The lag, combined with the intuitive/unexpected paradox of its awkward ‚Äúlimited body‚Äù interaction, creates less of a mirror and more of a ‚Äúcall and response, and response‚Äù space - much like that of a poet and his/her audience. Meaning is found in the space between body and text, and the half-second lag becomes that space between. Its intention is to frustrate, excite, and make viewers work harder towards communication, in a complex inter-course.As viewer-participants learn how to perform this space, they move in new ways. Whether they are trying to ‚Äúspeak,‚Äù or doing their best to avoid it, hektor forces them to go between the same exaggerated gestures and jerky expressions that he does. I‚Äôve watched some viewers crawl into a ball and lash out at his words with their arms, others dance and play on the fringes in an attempt to speak quickly and all at once, while still others get up close to the screen and squirm around words, so as not to speak.enter is a recognition of the negotiations and contradictions inherent to the performance of communication, and of self.

This rather pragmatic analysis has led me to cognify a digitality in the the work that has become a formative part of my aesthetic of some, but not all works, specifically a body of works I am calling ""Volumetric Gestures"".The visual language of these works speaks in terms of the bitmap and the vector as well as form, line, gesture, and action; the aesthetic could be called ""digitalist"" perhaps, since ""digital"" simply describes a binary transcription.After completing a series of images working with 3D wireframe chalice forms, I was introduced by art historian Andrew Hershberger to the wireframe goblets of Paolo Ucello, hand-drawn in pencil with machinelike precision by the artist in 1450. This closed a circle for me, and made me realize the circularity and connectedness of time and thought.In the incorporation of technology-based art media in my studio practice, I feel there is a new modernism which I seek; one which escapes the postmodern loop and lives in the moment, a place beyond context. Data has been aestheticised, and aesthetics have been coded; we as artists are in a position of responsibility to leave some artifacts behind. The physical and data objects which I create are documents; created equally for the self, the stranger, and the process of creation.",3/20/06 0:00,http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1129781280241678429&q=colin+goldberg,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: postdigital,digitalist,audiovisual,ipod video,ipod,ipod moviesComments from user: This work is an exploration into process, capturing the drawing process via screen-recording software, and the audio editing software is recorded and used as background footage, after being effected and recomposited.

We need them to understand who we are, as individuals and as parts of a culture.EverybodyHurts.org is a hybrid art/fan site, which explores the idea that mediated emotion is as real as non-mediated emotion. It tells the story of my own personal connections to contemporary televisual fiction, while exploring such methods of meaning-making as collection, appropriation, cultural participation and creation. ‚ÄúEverybody Hurts‚Äù is a transmedia experience. It is a website, several videos and a series of embroideries which focus on various aspects of the experience of mediated emotion through the vehicle of television stills. Each embodiment of the project is pivotal to its meaning, because it emphasizes a different context for viewing and understanding the work. For example, the video slideshows can be seen both as large projections in a fine art gallery and as Fan-Vids on the website or on You-Tube. The embroideries have one meaning when experienced virtually on the website and another when viewed as art objects in a gallery setting.The website has a hybrid identity: part conceptual art piece, part television fan site, part archive.

This is a space in which everything has been frozen, the player has gone, leaving only the viewer as a voyeur, a witness.The 'game' is joined at the scene of a slaughter in the gallery, silent, bloody, grisly but understated, a melancholic place. A trail of blood traces the progression through a closed door. The next part of the level is obscured, perhaps it is a silent passage through cellers or a basement, perhaps an intense battle up a stairway into a neighbouring yard. The viewer rejoins the struggle from a distance - denied access by the striped tape that defines the edges of the game map; a high blood stained wall over which something has fallen, climbed, been dragged. The game area continues through the garden, winding between tress, a space cleared of debris, watered so it is a lighter shade of green from the viewers world. The trees have carefully placed leaves at their bases that suggest in-game textured planes to smooth the transition from one polygon to the next. The end of the level approaches; a pond, still, with a piece of white cloth suspended beneath the surface, the other end pulled taut over the side, dissapearing into a partially opened manhole cover. The only sounds; the city beyond the walled garden, the incessant sound of water pouring into the drains beneath the city: the end of the level...Evidencia#000 is the first part of a new series of works that explore the relationship between the 'real' and the 'game space'. Since coming across a fatal motorcycle crash, where a busy London street in rush hour was cordoned off, transformed into a silent, macabre 'set', I have been fascinated with the way that the forensic space dislocates the 'familiar'. The resultant sterile space, where every trace of activity, every fragment of debris is given potential significance, where scientists move in to analyse and de-construct the events, is in direct contrast to the First Person Shooter game space where players engage the tropes of massacre and desruction to advance through the level, leaving massive evidence trails with no apparent consequence.

New models, as seen in the imagination by the artist, become the foundation for new concepts and new possibilities for change. The insertion of these models into reality, however temporary or ephemeral, brings opportunity for social transformation through the exploitation of the power of the collective imagination.The Experimental Party has been devised as such a model, a vehicle for political critique and a laboratory for social experimentation. Just as art extends the ability of the recipient to ""suspend disbelief,"" the Experimental Party proposes new ways of seeing and understanding the world around us through the processes of virtualization.The Experimental Party is the culmination of a four year project conceived as an artistic critique of the political process. Based on the model of the political party, an active vehicle for citizens action, the Experimental Party is a shift to experimental thinking, a mediated environment, a system of communication and production, a collective event that enables the disenfranchised to enter into the political process with renewed hope and agencyThe final goal of the Experimental Party, as an artistic creation and act of mediation, is to propose a model of society where free and experimental modes of conduct will prevail. ",1/21/03 0:00,http://www.experimentalparty.org,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: virtualization, suspension of disbeliefComments from user: ""Perhaps the imagination is on the verge of recovering its rights.""

F2T, a creation by artists Frank Plant(United States) and Thomas Charveriat(France), combines sculpture, robotics, hip hop, and SMS messaging to explore the ways technology shapes the development of language, particularly new forms of slang.  Viewers interact directly with the artwork by sending it a short text message from their mobile. Once received, the SMS is scanned for frequently used words and, when a match is found, the four elements are activated. The main piece, ""Rapper"" begins to twist and wave his hand while mouthing a rap based on the message sent, the new lyrics culled from more than 130 different hip hop phrases written by Amsterdam-based lyricist and composer Jim Barnard. The rest of the piece is simultaneously set into motion: ""Boom Box"" starts flashing and blasting out the song while ""Joy Ride"" a bouncing low-rider, and ""Shake Ass"" (looks like it sounds) begins to move, triggered by ambient sound sensors. When the song is finished, a thermal printer spits out a souvenir with the original SMS and the words of the ""Rapper.""WATCH THE VIDEO!!!",11/18/03 0:00,http://www.montcada5.com/HTML/42_F2T(E1).html,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,Date created: 2003-11-18,11/18/03 0:00,,,"audio, Barcelona, CCCB, Collaborative, Conceptual, Database, HTML, installation, interact, Jim Barnard, language, live, machine, Observatori, Participatory, performance, posthuman, robot, Telematic, Thomas Charveriat, Valencia"2089,Fabrikverkauf,Frieder,Rusmann,Frieder Rusmann,"Buy in the e-shop of ""Fabrikverkauf"" a t-shirt designed by the artitst [art wear] and make an exhibition wearing it [walking exhibition]. Inform the world, when you will do this, on the website of ""Fabrikverkauf"".

Introduction to Fantastic Prayersby Michael GovanFantastic Prayers, Dia's first artists' project for the Web, is something of a story that plays out as a multimedia performance. The artists--writer/performer Constance DeJong, artist Tony Oursler, and musician/composer Stephen Vitiello --conceived the project independently of the Web. The work, in fact, began as plans for a performance for the rooftop of Dia's West Chelsea exhibition galleries. The work is conceived in fragments of text, sound, and images. It describes a place called Arcadia and its young residents living in a kind of idyllic Arcadian suspension that only becomes interrupted by the intrusion of another figure, another voice, that represents something of what is outside Arcadia--that is, time, memory, and death. This fantastical encounter is filled with playful exchanges and discoveries. While the performance was designed specifically for Dia's rooftop, around a glass and steel sculptural pavilion by Dan Graham, the artists reconfigured the piece to inhabit the electronic space of the Web. Similarly it will be adapted for other spaces--real and digital. Fantastic Prayers slid perfectly onto the electronic field of the Web because, perhaps like the amorphous body of fragments on the Web, the piece itself is conceived as fragments rather than a whole. And, although structured as a narrative, it has little of a beginning, middle, or end--like the experience of the Web. Instead, it moves around ideas and encounters, suggesting not only the content of the artists' intentions, but also an extraordinary approach to making an artwork that sheds the boundaries of time and space, exists in real and digital environments, and shifts with every new circumstance.This project was commissioned by the Dia Center for the Arts, with funding and support from Harvestworks Inc./Studio PASS, The Electronic Arts Grants Program of the Experimental Television Center, and The Bohen Foundation.",3/23/02 2:06,http://www.diacenter.org/rooftop/webproj/fprayer/mgintro.html,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/1834/awp.diaart.org/fp/,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,Date cloned: 2013-02-07,3/23/02 2:06,,,"allegory, audio, Collaborative, Constance DeJong, Dia Center for the Arts, exhibition, Fantastic Prayers, HTML, language, memory, Narrative, performance, Stephen Vitiello, Text, Tony Oursler"3124,fascinum,Christophe,Bruno,Christophe Bruno,"This piece lives on the Yahoo portal. It shows the pictures from the daily news that are the most viewed on different national Yahoo websites.

Currently it is set to record a pixel a second, so that a whole image is made up of individual pixels collected over 21.33 hours. Each image is collected from top to bottom and left to right in horizontal bands continuously.  The work is meant to be slow, a reflection on the ever increasing speeds we demand from the internet. It encodes the landscape over time, recording fluctuations in light and movement throughout the day (and night).Regularly updated stills can be viewed in the site's archive, whilst a downloadable (flash) application lets the work function as a distributable artwork which can be viewed full screen and updated live to your computer in real time.  For 12 months from May 2004, a webcam was placed on the roof of the Anchor Inn, a 17th century coaching inn in the heart of rural England, part of an area known as Silicon Fen overlooking the Great Ouse and the New Bedford River at Sutton Gault in Cambridgeshire, an area where technology is literally embedded in the flat horizons of a reclaimed landscape of canals, sluices, dykes and ditches.The webcam was programmed to record images a pixel a second, so that a whole image would be made up of individual pixels collected over 21.33 hours. Each image was collected from top to bottom and left to right in horizontal bands continuously.The result is Fenlandia, a series of gradually unfolding, classically romantic landscape images harvested and archived over the course of the year.The work is intended to be slow, a reflection on the ever increasing speeds we demand from the internet. It encodes the landscape over time, with different tonal horizontal bands recording fluctuations in light and movement throughout the day and with broad bands of black depicting nighttime. Stray pixels appear in the image where a bird, person, car or other unidentifiable object may have passed in front of the webcam as the pixel was captured.Time becomes intrinsic to the work as the previous 76800 seconds or 21.33 hours - just under a day - is displayed pixel by pixel within a continuously updating time lapse film caught in a single frame. Poised between the still and the moving image, the lens and the pixel, the work explores how images can be coded and decoded using both light and time as building blocks for the work.Commissioned by Film and Video Umbrella and Norwich School of Art for an online project, Silicon Fen (book forthcoming 2007), Fenlandia exists concurrently as a website; a networked full screen live transmission, and as a series of archival digital inkjet prints from the archive.Exhibitions include: Rhizome ArtBase 101; The Microwave Media Festival, Hong Kong; Digital Aesthetic 2, Harris Gallery, Preston; Video Vortex. media Art Institute, Amsterdam and a solo exhibition at Babylon Gallery, Ely, Cambridgeshire.",5/27/04 0:00,http://www.susan-collins.net/fenlandia,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/29627/,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: telematic, pixel, landscape, paintingDate created: 2004-05-27Date cloned: 2013-03-07",5/27/04 0:00,,,"Anchor Inn, Cambridgeshire, Conceptual, Database, East Anglia, Event, exhibition, Fenlandia, Film and Video Umbrella, Formalist, Generative, Glenlandia, HTML, installation, Internet, landscape, Matt Jarvis, nature, netart, network, Norwich Art School, Pixelscape for Glastonbury Tor, Silicon Fen, Simon Schofield, Slade Centre for Electronic Media, Spectrascope, Susan Alexis Collins, Susan Collins, susan-collins.net, Sutton Gault, Transporting Skies, Visual, webscape"30706,Field of Vision: New York,Stephan,Hausmeister,Digital Art Projects,"‚Äú‚ÄòIn my field of vision I can see the image of a tree on the right hand side of the image of a tower, or ‚ÄòI can see the image of a tree in the middle of the field of vision.‚Äô And now we are tempted to ask: ‚ÄòAnd where do you see the field of vision?‚Äô ‚Äù             Ludwig Wittgenstein, The Blue Book.   In response to Wittgenstein‚Äôs question Digital Art Projects locates the human field of vision as a multidimensional space in the mind.

I am also extremely interested in the relationship between man and urban environment, in particular how this breeds a nostalgia for the natural, our disengagement from history, and a uncomfortable apathy about both. The books of R.D Laing on the idiosyncrasies of modern society, and the novels of Orwell, Huxley and Sartre have all influenced the work I make. <p>This interest in the language of television and computing is not only the impetus for making art, providing the drive to do something creative, but also forms the medium for much of my artwork. I love the quality of the electric image, and find the contrast between their luminocity and the beige boxes that generate them extremely interesting. <p>I use computer equipment and imagery as source, but I try to reposition and recontextualise the information we receive through these devices, through alternative methods of collection and presentation. The internet search engine Google, in particular its image-search feature, here becomes an important tool in gathering imagery, as it already begins the process of removing images from their context. This process allows us to view masses of images in a pseudo-objective way which allows for patterns to form, which allows for instant recognition of existing trends and prejudices. <p>While using computer imagery, I remain very conscious of the physical nature of our information devices, and take great pleasure in the ability to play with them in a very physical way.

After some experimentation I developed a model for representing the underlying structure of ""physical"" lines, in which a finite-element, mass-spring-damper simulation is composed of virtual particles connected by alternating linear and torsional springs. The model has the effect of simulating the tensile properties of thin physical filaments, such as hairs or twigs. I used this physical model to create a series of reactive drawing systems, including Floccus. In Floccus (the name is a Latin term for ""hairball""), ductile filaments drawn by the user swirl around a shifting, imaginary drain centered at the user's cursor. These filaments--torn by conflicting impulses to simultaneously preserve their length, yet also move towards or away from the cursor--find an equilibrium by forming gnarly, tangled masses.

Is a 3d-Based Game created by Michael Salmond for the web. There exists a larger version of the game that is part of a gallery installation.FPS is a first person shooter, but with a twist. The player uses the mouse (right-click to shoot) as a ‚Äògun‚Äô to shoot targets that randomly appear in a simulation of a police-training mission. To all intents and purposes, FPS is what it seems to be, a game in which you shoot at targets to gain points and complete the ‚Äòmission‚Äô. However, there is a conundrum contained in this work - an ethical conundrum.A player has two forms of targets to shoot, the ‚Äòhostage‚Äô and the ‚Äòcriminal‚Äô. The difference between ‚Äòvictim‚Äô and ‚Äòperpetrator‚Äô is at times very slight and you have to make split second decisions. The player is offered positive and negative reinforcement based on their shooting ‚Äòskill‚Äô - however the point system is what offers the ethical dilemma. When a player shoots a target denoted as a ‚Äòcriminal‚Äô positive reinforcement and an upping of your personal score occurs. When a player shoots (by accident or on purpose) a ‚Äòhostage‚Äô target, then the simulation offers them a negative reinforcement  but the score increases by a much more significant amount. Herein lies the conundrum, does the player adhere to the spirit and rules of the gaming scenario or do they go for the visceral thrill of shooting everything and gaining a much higher score?FPS works within these two facets of the video game genre, the concept of realistic simulation where rules must be adhered to or the gamer is ‚Äòpunished‚Äô and other more visceral games where shooting pretty much anything that the player encounters is a measurement of survival and success. Within these disparate game environments ‚ÄòFPS‚Äô offers one last element - that of asking the player ‚ÄúHow Do You Feel‚Äù on completion of their task. Video games very rarely directly involve the player or ask them to think of their biological self within the game state or environment. The player enters the immersive environment and is then pulled out at the end and, effectively, returned to their reality and at this point the game assumes a passive role. FPS asks the player directly how they feel, what is their personal level of guilt, pleasure, anxiety and so on. By doing this game refuses to deliver the player back to their world completely without some form of continuation of the game-state.Michael Salmond 2006 FPS is a first person shooter, but with a twist.

To awaken an indifferent world, he proposes creating in advance memorials to honor the millions of men, women, and children murdered in a second Holocaust.  The global reach of a networked planet gives artists unprecedented power to express their moral outrage as a worldwide call to action to confront hatred, bigotry, racism, terrorism, genocide, and cults of death and destruction.Artists in the past have exhibited the moral courage to confront evil through their paintings, drawings, and prints, from the etchings of Goya recording the horrors of Napoleon‚Äôs invasion, George Grosz‚Äôs drawings of the catastrophe of  World War I - the disabled, crippled, and mutilated - and his caricatures ridiculing Hitler and his Nazi henchmen,  to Picasso‚Äôs Guernica crying out against the bombing practice by Hitler‚Äôs burgeoning war machine killing hundreds in a little Basque village in northern Spain. Just as the world‚Äôs acquiescence to Hitler‚Äôs raining bombs on the village of Guernica gave him the license to proceed with preparing for WW II and exterminating the Jews of Europe on his way to global conquest, the world‚Äôs indifference to the thousands of rockets launched against Israel by Iran‚Äôs proxy armies, Hamas and Hizbullah, are empowering Ahmedinejad to incinerate the Jews of Israel as a prelude to his global jihad.   On seeing this work of webart, Kenneth Treister artist/architect of the acclaimed environmental artwork, the Holocaust Memorial on Miami Beach, commented: ‚ÄúI do not remember being struck so sharply, like a thunder strike, by a work of art, in any form.  It is so powerful.  In a simple way, you tell a message that is both urgent and so sad.‚Äù  Otto Piene, Professor Emeritus and Director of MIT‚Äôs Center for Advanced Visual Studies, wrote: ‚ÄúMel Alexenberg, a very sophisticated artist and scholar of much experience in the complex playing field of art-science-technology, addresses the rarely asked question: How does the ""media magic"" communicate content?‚Äù  The photograph here shows five generations of the artist's family that the Iranian regime plans to incinerate:  his great-grandson, his grandaughter, his wife, and his mother-in-law.

Installation video, television, chair, set table, glass and jug of water.So Baudrillard is dead, even if he might dispute it and conceivably like Borge's magically divine cat in El Sur 1: he is living in an ever present and eternal future. Now here, in the context of this 2007 Future Brisbane exhibition, it possibly makes no sense to go back to 1995 to contemplate the future, but are we not a composite of the memories of experience and I wonder if it is this that guides us to at least expect and be comforted that there will be at least one or hopefully a series of futures to come. Perhaps contemplating another Baudrillard is it simply this, that like Banville's narrator's Dr. Browne ""The long habit of living indisposeth (him) for dying"" 2:Of course as I understand it, Baudrillard who embodies a tradition of serious phenomenological doubters from Barthes, Debord and Nietzsche back to Socrates via Plato on the nature of all representation, has a very strong view that we are doomed to a representational existential impasse in regard to the future. For Baudrillard the past never really happened except as an ideological driven image therefore the future cannot have a teleological component. i.e. we are captives of our own representations and against Hegel cannot learn from history.So back to 1995 I arrived bright eyed and bushytailed at the Museum of Contemporary Art Sydney for a Baudrillard lecture on his 2nd visit to OZ. I was supposed to attend with my wife and brother in law, but they at the last minute decided that a dinner at Wolfies on the Rocks would be a much more productive way to spend a summer evening. While I standing on principle and against the betrayal grabbed a plastic boxed cheese burger at the Quay and headed for the MCA.To save time I decided to tackle the cheese burger in the MCA lift. One bite was enough to convince me of a couple of things. One was, if I had not already learned from history or at least experience that in advertising there is a vast difference between the representation and the reality and probably the big one, that in a moment you can make a seemingly reliable principled decision in the hunger for knowledge that may or may not change your life forever, but could be a bit of a bummer in the moment. I think Wolfies was serving the last of Sydney‚Äôs famed Rock Oysters that nightI had a further problem, that was how to be rid of the part eaten cheese burger, no bins around but there was a handy niche in the lift wall. So taking a creative approach and a very now, well then now kind of interventionist approach I installed the bun in the niche and took a photograph. I rode the lift a couple of times to make sure the roll was perfectly placed, my first work and only work in the MCA had to be right.I made it into the MCA convention hall in the nick of time and settled into a mid row place in my wheelchair and waited expectantly. The expectantly went on a little too long and out of boredom I began to take an aesthetic interest in the space and the set up. My first impression was that of the framing of the elegant Ramada Renaissance Hotel lit neon signage in the tall neo-classical window of the hall. Second on the speakers dais I observed a beautifully set table, the table was covered with a to the floor white tablecloth and on the tablecloth a designer jug and glass were filled with water that shimmered and quivered with the vibration of traffic.Further to that I noticed Baudrillard himself sitting in the front row just waiting it appeared like us for himself, it all seemed a frozen tableau. I could not help myself and pulled out the Leica, set it on a longue dure exposure and began shooting as surruptiously as I could. I was quickly brought to heel by a left bank style MCA minder in a victim of style black polo neck top. A tap on the shoulder, a wiggle of the finger, a ‚Äúno photographs allowed‚Äù. Christ I said, ‚ÄúThis is the 20 th Century!‚Äù He didn't get it.I have to admit Baudrillard for all his experiences in the excesses of representational apparatus is a bit of a dry as dust speaker for a media star. He was reading from a prepared text and didn‚Äôt look up much. I was getting hungry. My concentration was broken, merde I thought no probably Schei√üe being more a German phenomenological fan. Another tap on the shoulder, oops I had kept shooting off my lap and to be frank was prepared to cop it sweet and be ejected. I turned to find however not the polo neck but a young artist friend who beckoned me outside. ""I am having a bit of an existential moment""""You look the goods what's wrong?"" I said to my young friend who had just come out, he/she had arranged to meet a certain curator there but had suddenly got cold feet. I was commandeered to be the support team for the meet, so we headed to the gallery space where Baudrillard's photographs were being displayed.The two were getting on swimmingly and I felt a little superfluous, so I said good night and decided to head outside and wait for the family, on the way take another bite out of cheese burger and a have a good look at Jeff Koons Puppy by night. Do you know a question was asked of Koons, just what was his art all about? He answered blithely, ""I just want to make people smile. ""Now if that's his gig to be optimistic about the future who can complain. I sat and waited chewing the last of the retrieved cheese burger, contemplated Puppy, Lacan style, contemplating me, contemplating strollers-by contemplating Puppy and a warm warm feeling came over me not quite of jouissance perhaps, but such a feeling that I just couldn't help but smile.1.

GHOST CITY is a labyrinthine environment through which  viewers can navigate, either following the linear narrative that unfolds by moving from page to page, or they can delve into the non-linear chaos of random links.

The texts are either found passages from urban theory or specifically written poetic musings on the city. Rather than present static images, GHOST CITY is a collage of moving parts. It is a pulsating grid of flashing images that loop indefinitely. The viewer is an urban wanderer moving through the site, step by step, page by page. One moves forward and back retracing ones steps within the urban grid, discovering new spaces and new meanings. GHOST CITY is about memory, and about traveling through time and space. The time is infinite. The space is finite. Yet the time and space of GHOST CITY metaphorically relate to the experience of the city where people walk and talk and interact.

Given Time simultaneously activates and performs two permanently logged-in Second Life avatars, each forever and only seen by and through the other. They hover in mid-air, almost completely still, gazing into one another‚Äôs interface. Viewers encounter this networked partnership as a diptych of large-scale and facing video projections in a real world gallery, both exhibiting a live view of one avatar, as perceived by the other. To create a visceral aesthetic, these custom-designed and life-sized ‚Äúbodies‚Äù are hand-drawn in subtly animated charcoal, graphite and pastel. The audience is invited to physically walk between them; they‚Äôre able to hear and see them breathing, witness their hair blowing in the wind, pick up faint sounds such as rushing water or birds crying out from the surrounding simulated environment. Here, an intimate exchange between dual, virtual bodies is transformed into a public meditation on human relationships, bodily mortality, and time‚Äôs inevitable flow.Second Life (SL) is a 3D social network accessed exclusively by logging in as a representational character. Real life ‚Äúresidents‚Äù experience SL through a computer game-like first-person interface, and are seen by others as human-like forms. Every avatar in SL‚Äôs virtual buildings and streets has a corresponding person somewhere in the physical world. There is no entry to SL without a user, computer, and avatar; we perceive, act, activate and are activated through our virtual interactions with its residents. In Given Time, however, there are no users, and the SL ‚Äúin-world‚Äù location is not made available. These avatars are realized only through each other and their publicly shared installation and engagement, incarnated through a feedback loop across virtual and actual space.Although Given Time invests in and points to relationships, embodiment and time, it renders them all, literally, im-material. While SL suggests people behind every avatar, these performers are precisely no one and no-body; the time and space in which they unfold do not actually exist, except as part of a networked computer software held loosely together by intangible encounters. While the computers and projections sit side by side in the real world, and the avatars face one another in SL‚Äôs imagined world, they are only ‚Äúthere‚Äù as electrical pulses sent through, potentially, thousands of miles of telecommunications wires that circle the globe. It is a meeting between ever-present entities that are also not-there until we give them our eyes and our flesh. We, the viewers, act as their real-world and material avatars, giving life to the space between them.Given Time‚Äôs minimal aesthetic and avatar-driven partnership is not dissimilar to Felix Gonzales-Torres‚Äô slowly dying battery operated clocks in Untitled (Perfect Lovers). But this piece does not ask us to reflect on private grief or public yearning, on loss, death or desire. Instead, it asks, ‚ÄúWhen we have already given everything - our desires, bodies, and time - what, then, is left to give?‚Äù It is a tension, hovering in the air, tracing the invisible and untouchable connection that is no-thing and every-thing.

Global Presidential Election enables you to vote for a global leader from a pool of thirteen dictators using a voting system based upon the model of American democracy. To make your vote more potent, in Global Presidential Election you are eligible to purchase and/ or subtract votes for your choice of global leader. For USD $10 dollars Global Presidential Election will allow your one vote to count as 1,000. Our Absentee Ballot Program subtracts 150 actual votes from candidates of your choice for only USD $2.The goal of this project is to examine the rhetoric surrounding America‚Äôs favorite buzzword, Democracy. With the current state of international relationships both economically and politically seeing power struggles and consolidation in the form of inequality and war, we have created an installation/performance/website in the form of mock elections that asks much needed questions about the nature of the Democracy the West is so keen on selling. HIGHLIGHTS:Resources available on the GlobalElection.org website include: -Thirteen candidates were chosen to ensure the global democracy- George W Bush, Saddam Hussein, Ariel Sharon, Idi Amin, Pol Pot, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Silvio Berlusconi, to name a few.-Voter are encouraged to write-in their own candidates.-Voter can purchase 1000 votes for USD $10 and cast it to their favorite global leader.-Voter can subtract 150 votes for their choice of leader for USD $2 with our Absentee Ballot program.-Viewers can download Powerpoint presentation and voting pamphlet and set up their own global election.HISTORY:Global Elections was first conceived of in May 2003 as a project for a show at Cox 18, in Milan, Italy. At the time the United States government under the Bush administration had just raised its own method of terrorism, by escalating the threat of war to actual invasion, using the banner of Democracy, Freedom, and fear of ‚ÄúMass Destruction‚Äù to further this agenda. The problems with this notion of Democracy, particularly in a time of aggressive global capitalism are manifold. It is with this in mind that Global Elections was created to ask important questions about what is meant by the usage of a term that once implied a chance to participate in one‚Äôs own life. What can a vote change? What, and who are we allowed to vote for? Most importantly, what are the differences between individual interests and the interests of career politicians with strong ties to corporate lobbyists? (We may actually call them ‚Äúsponsors‚Äù now). Initially, Global Elections was executed as a performance. A voting pamphlet was printed with candidates selected from current, high profile heads of state, along side of some of the twentieth centuries most notorious ‚Äúleaders‚Äù, and a situation was constructed where participants could vote. By careful selection of candidates, as well as accompanied by texts listing their ‚Äúaccomplishments‚Äù, it was intended to ask several, pointed questions about the nature of Democracy in it‚Äôs new configuration within an over all schema of global capitalism.Since it‚Äôs launching as a performance, GE has taken to operating as a campaign. A website GlobalElection.org has been constructed with infrastructures, pages and contents that mirror many of those found owned and operated by the US government. Within these pages, texts have been placed that appropriates the actual language of these official sites, manipulated to reveal just where the logic of particular facts in today‚Äôs democracy leads. By functioning as performance, in conjunction with it‚Äôs placement as a form of internet activism, Global Elections does not seek to provide answers to the problems posited by the usage of the term, ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù, but to reveal it as the language of propaganda.Previous Global Elections:COX 18, Milan, Italy, June 2003 (elected candidate: Mao Tse Tung)Shedhalle, Z√ºrich, Switzerland, June 2004 (tie result: Slobodan Milosevic and Arnold Schwarzenegger)Version04 Festival, Chicago, IL, USA, May 2004 (elected candidate: Arnold Schwarzenegger)Future Global Elections:APAture 2004, Kearny Street Workshop, San Francisco, U.S.A., September 2004NACHT DER BILDER I, HAU Hebbel Am Ufer, Berlin, Germany, October, 2004Contact Info:Interviews and PR please contact:Kenneth HungDirector@GlobalElection.org+1 (415) 606-6184Interviews and PR in Europe please contact:Tim BlueSecretary@GlobalElection.orgYou can also download a .pdf format of this press release at:http://www.GlobalElection.org/downloads/pressrelease1.pdf####",7/26/04 0:00,http://www.globalelection.org/,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/27757/,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: election, e-vote, subversive, arnachy, disobedienceComments from user: Please vote in this election.

Similar to Christo's planting of giant pink umbrellas along a California highway, Goodworld forces a frantic website into a child-like vocabulary of color and abstraction. GoodWorld takes the conventional framework of a commercial site (or any site for that matter) and re-appropriates the text and images, forming an entirely new work. The code picks the most prominent image on the page and turns it into an abstracted reproduction of the original. This is done by choosing the dominant RGB value from a select number of pixels, and then tracing that color using Ming -- a PHP library -- and Shockwave Flash. What you see is a real-time phantom representation of the original sketched in magenta squares. Most, if not all, of the remaining images on the page are turned into yellow 'wrappers' and the text and links are transformed into '* __ *' -- symbolizing a complacent happy face. For many people, the 'online experience' has become a bombardment with Orbitz pop-up windows and sneaky ad tactics, i.e. seemingly endless spawning windows, fake windows, etc. We've grown accustomed to being interrupted by flashing ad banners selling investment services while reading the latest news about a pending nuclear attack. GoodWorld neutralizes the Web by wiping out content and unifying all pages into one creation. Hence the whole world becomes a 'Good World' in the eye of the artist -- or possibly an unsettled dilution of the safe and familiar we've come to expect.

Specifically, the piece explores the way tools such as Google Image Search have altered our visual understanding of words and text. The Google Image Search technology allows the user to search for images using natural language keywords and phrases. Does the use of this technology create a closer relationship between words and imagery, or does it further alienate the visual from the linguistic?""Google Image Search: The First Amendment"" was created by performing a Google Image Search for each word in the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. Using the search results, I created a visual narrative of this historical text. The imagery that resulted from this process ranges from the mundane to the bizarre. I selected the First Amendment because I am interested in revealing new meanings and representations of historically and culturally important texts. In particular, I think that First Amendment rights are facing a multitude of threats at this moment in time, and I hope that this piece will encourage viewers to examine the language and meaning of the document more closely. I intend to further explore these ideas in a series of pieces that will apply the same techniques to a variety of other seminal works.

The Gr@fite project abuses of this culture material, exploring the potential of the digital generative art and its possibilities, constructing a sonorous poetical experimentation and is visually interactive. This is another way to express the multiple markets already existing of the sonorous visual expression. Gr@fite is a reactive, generative and interactive use of the software, where the applications figure as an amusement, a game where the user enters, and the rules are given so the user can make its choices of action. Depending on the objects chosen and the interaction of the user, he can be either a graphite artist or a DJ. Perhaps the most original characteristic of this interactive experimentation is that it allows that the emergent phenomena are considered. An emergent phenomenon cannot be foreseen, nor can it be entirely explained or simply moved away. The emergent phenomena are, over all those that cannot be foreseen by the behavior of its components.

The primary - rather poetical - narrative level is emotionally broken and disrupted in content by a second controversial communication level. The audiovisual storyline - the personal message - a combination of sign/body/text/image/drawing/symbol/voice is confronted with a conceptional media-theoretical examination. Statement, formal design, and composition of the audiovisual narrative are subversively criticised and satirised. It is the clip's dynamic visual and interactive assurance which prompts the viewer to leave the actual storyline, and refers to more interesting issues and sites (a whole universe). The clip's script and directives:POOR CAT - the prodigious shift of an artistic perspectivea path to artvariations on self-referential systemsno philosophical theory?only emptiness and abstractnessno political truth?only mathematical structurenot socially relevant?only a synaesthetic continuuma visual experience only?elegantcharmingpreciseexciting - spectacularnot corrupt?not √©litist?a little songtoo simple?too few action?a short moviea blue skyless action?analogy : contrastonly a memory of friendshipalmost like real lifetricky worlda metaphor for the dreaming social mindnot visionary enough?thenthey choose amokthe story of a voyage into the anonymity of empty spacetableau [1] Japan onetableau [2] cluster of panictableau [3] museum of private artstableau [4] the sleepertableau [5] translocationa whole universe?choose amokor stay!amok - fast server live in the spirit of deconstructionpoor cat1982-2008interested in another space?if it?do itnow!click!missed!Script, graphic design, animation, video, performance, composition, instruments, voices, programming, production ¬© GRAF+ZYX, Vienna : all rights reserved(translation: Simone von der Geest)---Musikvideo 01:30 min.

Master List2000 is a project that uses image spam as a way to generate visual content and user interaction. It does so by addressing some of the issues surrounding image spam like the overload of advertising imagery that constantly clouds and pollutes our visual/mental environment by finding increasingly more invasive ways of reaching the viewer.The site and animation were created from a database collection of image spam collected over a 2 month period. Image spam advertising techniques pollute our visual and mental landscapes in a back and forth game between filtering systems and bots designed to fool them. Far from being invisible filtered junk, they become part of a disposable visual culture. But how much visual garbage are we willing to put up with? What happens when the content of image spam shifts its focus and becomes more visible?

Something which has been entertained by Lev Manovich in his book, The Language of New Media.  Through this project, I expose how random access has affected cultural communication.We no longer have to think linearly. People now have the capacity to access  content at random through links.  This is true for websites,  DVDs, and CD-Roms.  All we need is a database and the proper interface to access random information.Rosalind Krauss presents the grid as anti-narrative--as the new  religious device that deprives culture of progress. In this project, Krauss' own narrative is problematized when the 30 paragraphs of her essay are split into 30 seperate links which now the user can access at random.  Her own narrative has now  become anti-narrative or random information -- with no beginning or end (no progress), but rather a never-ending cycle; just like the grid that she refers to in her writing.The links are invisible, and so the surfer must move the mouse and discover one paragraph at a time, while trying to make sense of the narrative as the links retrieve information from the database.Sources:Manovich, Lev.

If a person has free will (as defined by incompatibilists), then his actions will be unpredictable by other people and will contain an element of irreducible indeterminacy. By religious or supernatural conceptions of incompatibilist free will, such human actions may be the only source of randomness in the universe. (According to the naturalistic conception, by contrast, incompatibilist free will arises from pre-existing indeterminacy in physical laws and is not necessarily a unique feature of humans. According to the compatibilist conception, there is no randomness and humans are merely too complex to be easily predicted).Some theologians have attempted to resolve the apparent contradiction between an omniscient deity, or a first cause, and free will using randomness. Discordians have a strong belief in randomness and unpredictability. Buddhist philosophy states that any event is the result of previous events (karma) and as such there is no such thing as a random event nor a 'first' event.Martin Luther, the forefather of Protestantism, believed that there was nothing random based on his understanding of the Bible. As an outcome of his understanding of randomness he strongly felt that free will was limited to low level decision making by humans. Therefore, when someone sins against another, decision making is only limited to how one responds preferably through forgiveness and loving actions. He believed based on Biblical scripture that humans cannot will themselves, faith, salvation, sanctification, or other gifts from God. Additionally, the best people could do according to his understanding was not sin but they fall short and free will cannot achieve this objective. Thus, in his view absolute free will and unbounded randomness are severely limited to the point that behaviors may even be patterned or ordered and not random. This is a point emphasized by the field of behavioral psychology.These notions and more in Christianity often lend to a highly deterministic worldview and that the concept of random events is not possible. Especially, if purpose is part of this universe then randomness, by definition, is not possible. This is also a foundation for Intelligent Design which is counter to Evolution that remarks the natural emerges based on random selection.Donald Knuth, a Stanford computer scientist and Christian commentator, remarks that he finds pseudo-random numbers useful and applies them with purpose. He then extends this thought to God who may use randomness with purpose to allow free will to certain degrees. Knuth believes that God is interested in peoples decisions and limited free will allows a certain degree of decision making. Knuth, based on his understanding of quantum computing and entanglement, comments that God exerts dynamic control over the world without violating any laws of physics suggesting that what appears to be random to humans may not, in fact, be so random",6/20/07 0:00,http://www.holos.net/rhizome/gurus/index.html,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,,6/20/07 0:00,,,"Conceptual, dictator, Documentary, Flash, god, guru, historical, incompatibilist, indeterminacy, Intelligent Design, interact, karma, omniscient deity, politics, Protestantism, random, saint, Third World, War"42218,g_i_o_c_a_t_t_o_l_i,Salvatore,Iaconesi,Salvatore Iaconesi,"8 javaScript toys for a happier internet.Websites seem to be ever more demanding in terms of data and content.

They then physically explore the installation space as well as a virtual environment, which is projected onto the wall in front of them. As they walk around the space, they listen to the musings of the character they have chosen to ‚Äòbecome‚Äô: a little girl, an elderly lady or a young doctor. These characters (through a pre-recorded script created by writers each assuming one of the characters) reflect upon their ideals, values, hopes and dreams. The whimsical exchange between characters is based on everyday moments and activities. When there is more than one person in the space, a conversation between characters is triggered when people approach one another.

It embodies people‚Äôs feelings or intentions. Human emotions arise from complex external and internal contexts.How does the artist contain human emotions in an electronic canvas? Many computer generated drawings have abstract forms. My project ,‚ÄùHeartbeat Drawing‚Äù connects human and machine mind and body. The possession of innate emotion in non-human intellects is primarily a philosophical topic. Many scientists have studied how computers can be more emotionally intelligent, especially responding √úto a person‚Äôs feelings. In my project, physical -digital interfaces provide the connective tissue between our bodies and the codes represented in our machines. √úI take these interfaces in an emotional way. Emotional understanding refers to the ability of a device to detect emotional information. Interactive computer systems have been built that can begin to detect and label aspects of human emotional expression. I use a Heart beat sensor to detect human emotions. Not only does the heart contain feelings and emotion metaphorically, it actually processes emotional information and communicates it to the brain. Abstract expressionism is a parallel process of the heart/brain interface. √úMy electronic canvas is affected by the inner response of the body, not by exterior response. The goal of my project is to enrich and facilitate emotional interactivity between human and the machine, giving emotional meaning to my electronic painting. Background research Expressionism artwork often reflects a desire to communicate the individual's inner state, a highly emotional state of mind.To the abstract expressionist, Painting had to be direct, immediate, and spontaneous. Their work is characterized by a strong dependence on what appears to be accident and chance, but which is actually highly planned.How does the heart reflect the mind?Emotion is fundamental to human experience, influencing cognition, perception, and everyday tasks such as learning, communication, and even rational decision-making. Inner states such as emotion and feeling are connected to the body. Affect has been isunderstood and is difficult to measure. The Heart beat is a part of bodily expression of emotion. Detecting emotional information usually involves passive sensors which capture data about the user's physical state or behavior. The data gathered is often analogous to the cues humans use to perceive emotions in others. Recognizing emotional information requires the extraction of meaningful patterns from the gathered data. This is done by parsing the data through various processes . I use a heartbeat sensor to detect a emotion. Recent biomedical research has revealed that the heart is not just a simple pump, but a highly complex, self-organized information processing center with its own functional ""brain."" With each beat, the heart continuously communicates with the brain and body via the nervous system, hormonal system, bioelectromagnetic interactions, and other pathways. At the HeartMath Research Center, they are demonstrating that the messages the heart sends the brain not only affect physiological regulation, but can also influence perception, emotions, behaviors, performance, and health. The heart and brain maintain a continuous two-way dialogue, with each influencing the other's functioning. Of the bodily organs, the heart plays a particularly important role in our emotional experience. The experience of an emotion results from the brain, heart and body acting in concert.It is now known that the signals the heart sends the brain can influence perception, emotional processing, and higher cognitive functions. Some research is exploring the influence of the heart's input on brain activity, emotional perception and experience, and cognitive performance. They have shown that emotion-related changes in the heart's rhythmic activity are correlated with distinct changes in these variables. We now know that the heart sends more information to the brain than the brain sends to the heart. And the brain responds to the heart in many important ways. The heart, as an energetic system, examines the heart's field as a carrier of emotional information and a mediator of bioelectromagnetic communication, both within and outside the body. This research has shown that our heart's field changes distinctly as we experience different emotions. This change is registered by the brains of people around us. As we experience feelings like anger, frustration, anxiety and insecurity, our heart rhythm patterns become more erratic. These erratic patterns are sent to the emotional centers in the brain, which it recognizes as negative or stressful feelings. These signals create the actual feelings we experience in the heart area and the body. HeartMath‚Äôs research shows that when we experience heart-felt emotions like love, care, appreciation and compassion, the heart produces a very different rhythm. In this case it is a smooth pattern that looks like gently rolling hills. Harmonious heart rhythms, which reflect positive emotions, are considered to be indicators of cardiovascular efficiency and nervous system balance.The fact is, emotions do affect the heart. This picture allows you to see how emotions affect your heart rhythmsInteraction  The real time drawings are created based on the information coming from each individual participant through the heart beat information. Variation of the rate, pulse, rhythm and speed of THE heart beat determine the color, shape and pattern of the drawing. For example, as we experience feelings like anger, frustration, anxiety and insecurity, our heart rhythm patterns become more erratic. These erratic patterns are sent to the emotional centers in the brain, which it recognizes as negative or stressful feelings. When we experience heart-felt emotions like love, care, appreciation and compassion, the heart produces a very different rhythm. In this case it is a smooth pattern that looks like gently rolling hills. Harmonious heart rhythms, which reflect positive emotions, are considered to be indicators of cardiovascular efficiency and nervous system balance.This everchanging shape is created by the viewer's heartbeat. The drawings and paintings in this installation are controlled by the heart beat monitor connected to the Ezio interface and a computer. The software is written in processing. The viewer's heart beat √údeterminds the color pallette and character of drawing. The rate, pulse rhythm and speed of heart beat corresponds to the color, shape, pattern and speed. The fact is, emotions do affect the heart, and this heart beat does affect the drawings.  <COLOR CHART ;Color Preferences Reveal Your Personality >Ever wonder why there are so many colors of new cars to chose from? What about the color of your shirt or blouse? What color is your bedroom? Your preferences for certain colors is a very personal one and psychologists -as well as marketing researchers - have studied the question of why certain colors appeal to certain peoplefor years. These answers may lie in our attitudes towards life, as well as our emotional states.Color is an inseparable part of our everyday lives and its presence is evident in everything that we perceive.It is widely recognized that colors have also a strong impact on our emotions and feelings (Hemphill, 1996; Lang, 1993; Mahnke, 1996). The most familiar test is perhaps the test devised in the 1940s by the swiss psychologistMax Luscher, which according to his organization is now used widely in ethnographical research, medical diagnosisand therapy, gerontology and personnel selection. The Full test uses seventy-threecolour -patches, but a short and handy version includes only eight samples;dark blue, blue green, orange red, bright yellow. viloet, brown, black and grey. the subject is asked to arrange the coloured cards in a descending order ofpreference, and an analysis of this order over a number of test-runs alloweds the psychologiststo interpre the subject's character. this interpretation is predicted on the meanings attributedto the colours. thus blue, which Luscher, LIKE MOST modern phychologists has identified as the most widely preferred colour among europeans, is held to be concentric, passive, sensitive,perceptive, unifying, and so on, and thus to express tranquility, tenderness, and love and affection'Orange -red, however, is eccentric, active, offensive, aggressive, autonomous and competitiveand hence expressive of desire, domination and sexuality. the section of the public to whichthe Luscher Test is chiefly directed may be inferred from the interpretation it givesto an ordering which puts blue at the beginning and red towards the end of the sequence;color symbolism The basic colours have fundamental psychological properties that are universal, regardless of which particular shade, tone or tint of it you are using. Each of them has potentially positive or negative psychological effects and which of these effects is created depends on the relationships within colour combinations.For instance, the color red has been associated with excitement, orange has been perceived as distressingand upsetting, purple as dignified and stately, yellow as cheerful, and blue has been associated with comfort and security (Ballast, 2002; Wexner, 1982). Moreover, some colors may be associated with several different emotions and some emotions are associated with more than one color (Linton, 1999, Saito, 1996). Red, symbolically known as a dominant and dynamic color, has an exciting and stimulating hue effect. It has both positive and negative impressions such as active, strong, passionate, warm, but on the other hand aggressive, bloody, raging and intense. Green has been found to have a retiring and relaxing effect. It too has both positive and negative impressions such as refreshment, quietness, naturalness, and converselytiredness and guilt (Davey, 1998, Mahnke, 1996, Saito, 1996).ConclusionMy project asks the question how can we show changes of human emotions on an electronic canvas as abstract expressionist did in their paintings . This is based on abstract expressionist goal. My work is continuously changed by people's heartbeat. This project allows the transfer of pure emotion directly onto the canvas. The heartbeat creates dynamic compositions, everchanging the shape and undulating the rhythm. This interface has the ability to sense, recognize, and respond to the human communication of emotion.My artworks connect mind and body. I believe that electronic painting can convey emotional content and create a subjective experience for the viewer.referenceInstitute of heartmath , research, http://www.heartmath.org/research/research-publications.html heartbeat drawing My canvas is not a picture, but an event. Most drwaings are things expressive.

The result is a vast archivewhere different opinions and languages co-habit, an ethnographic recordabout what it means to feel well and feel in place today. The Parasitesection investigates the parasite's relation to media and communicationsystems, the relationship of parasite to host, or giver to taker in a systemof exchange. This section is modeled after a game: the killing game, thecontaining game and the propagating game.HOME TRANSFER is part of an ongoing cluster of works that Pat Badani beganin 1994. In these works, the artist uses a city made of bread-bowls and itsparasitic invasion as metaphor to explore social space. These ongoingprojects create communication paths between the artist, Citizens-at-large(both on-line and off-line), and specialists in different fields of Art,Science and Humanities (Bakers, Doctors, Architects). A discussion islaunched incorporating the public sphere via the Internet.Contact: pbadani@ilstu.edu",9/17/04 9:32,http://www.hometransfer.org/,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: Architecture, Home, New Technologies, Domestic Space, Place, Presence, Parasites",9/17/04 9:32,,,"allegory, archive, Database, disappearance, email, Flash, historical, Home Transfer, HTML, interact, Java, Participatory, Pat Badami, privacy, public space, RealPlayer, social space, space, Text, video"3245,Home-Maker,Jeanie,Finlay,Jeanie Finlay,"Home Maker explores what makes a house a home and how this changes if you cannot leave.Home Maker is the result of a Year of the Artist residency, which took place in the homes of four housebound older people in South Derbyshire, UK. Finlay spent time with each of the four people, getting to know them and making panoramic portraits of them which have now become part of an interactive, navigable online environment.By exploring the environment the viewer can visit Florrie, Roy, Betty and Lilian in their own living rooms and experience their histories, preoccupations and passions in the form of hidden mini video documentaries embedded in the online space.""Home-Maker came about as a direct result of working on the arts project Tea-Toast-Technology, which I was lead artist for. I worked with 50 people aged from 65-104 over two years, and was interested in continuing this experience gained through this participatory work into my own practice as an individual artist.I had used Quick Time vr in commercial commissions and was interested in how it could be used as a medium for portraiture in a domestic environment.I met Florrie, Roy, Lilian and Betty through Peoplexpress and social services in Derbyshire and were the final four chosen from the ten people I interviewed for the project.I visited each person around 8 times, chatting, drinking a lot of tea, taking photos and eventually taking video. As I got to know them they relaxed in front of the camera and opened up more about themselves. The mini documentaries show the stories that I was told over the time I spent with the subjects. I was keen that the videos reflected fairly the people I had met and their preoccupations. Florrie is good fun and well adjusted to living on her own, Lilan misses her husband dreadfully and feels cheated that he died before she did, Betty is very proud of her family and house and Roy is the self confessed 'anti-pensioner' who contradicts traditionally held stereotypes of house-bound older people in Britain, as tragic, introspective figures.I hope that the viewer gets a sense of being invited into and exploring a space they would never visit, getting a sense of the people they are presented with by their room and possessions, and hearing the intimate stories of four very individual people.""

Initially inspired by the Concretists, he developed a style of his own with bright colors in triangular shapes, which, in his later works, appear to move out of the frames into the infinity of space, which has become the distinguishing characteristic of B√¶rtling.I have been writing a computer program that creates new pictures that tries to recreate the work of Baertling. The code uses randomness to make every picture unique and different based on the work of Baertling. The program works fast and creates hundreds of pictures a minute and store them in PDF format that archives in a database.

Religious architectures often convey narratives through the passage across space, like Christ Cross Stations in churches for example, blending the story of the passion of Christ with  a prescribed route through the church space. Buildings and architectural spaces facilitate organization and memorization of information and have been woven together with narrative for  thousands of years. Can we combine narrative skills and modern digital technologies to add spirit, atmosphere and past lives to a location? Can we augment a place with a sense of historical narrative? An architectural space can provide context and the environment in which the narrative can be discovered by the reader. A location based interactive narrative must be built taking into account the architectural layout as well as the story structure and content. The author must consider the interactions and the movements of the viewers as part of the story experience and accommodate a reading that can happen from many different sides.The Hopstory project, explores how buildings can be used as containers of stories. How multiple point of view narrative structures can unfold through the physical exploration of real architectural spaces.

A Warm Database,Mariam,Ghani,Mariam Ghani,"How Do You See The Disappeared? A Warm Database was launched in December 2004 as the second stage of an ongoing, open-ended, collaborative project on disappearance, initiated in response to the drastic increase in detentions and deportations of immigrants after 9/11. For the web-based stage of the project, we identified a new strategy: to create alternative systems for collecting stories from the immigrants whose lives as individuals are lost in the abstractions of legalities and headlines, and to develop from those stories new terms and languages through which the issues of the immigration debate can be framed. The Warm Database designed for Turbulence serves three purposes: as an annotated guide for the uninitiated to and through the mountains of documents that surround detention, deportation and immigrants' rights; as a resource for and call to action; and as the starting point of a data collection project intended to span multiple communities and languages. In this web-based phase of the project, the collection process takes the form of a warm data questionnaire that anyone who has been affected by detention and deportation is invited to fill out (a solidarity version is also provided). This warm data questionnaire is designed to be voluntary, anonymous, and public: diametrically opposed to the questions asked during government processes like special registration, and to elicit data that will be the opposite of the cold, hard facts held in classified files. Some of the questions we asked ourselves while designing the database: What describes you but could never be held against you in a court of law? What would be the right questions to ask to know you without knowing your name?  The questionnaire responses collected over the past few years now form part of a physical archive of disappearance, which travels from site to site under the name Index of the Disappeared.How Do You See the Disappeared? A Warm Database was conceived and designed by Mariam Ghani, and produced in consultation with immigrant activists and advocates as well as in collaboration with Rob Durbin, Ed Potter and Chitra Ganesh.

In it, the users are asked to scan their hand and submit it to the project's server. This hand image is proccessed in real time and interpolated with other user's hands in order to form the image of a collective body part, a sort of 'exquisite corpse' that could be seen as a sign of pertinence as were the hand prints in prehistoric caves. The collective print of the ones who inhabit and transit the cyberspace.If we were to believe in quiromancy, we could also interpret the hand's lines as the writings of a collective destiny, always changing, as the hand changes with each new user's contribution. The user can see in real time how this contribution affects the image and the hand line patterns. The image of the body is digitalized and processed without ever going through a non-digital media, it looses corporality, as it enters the virtual world, and gains it back again, distorted and combined.Humanos v.1 has an installation version. In this version, the hands are gathered directly through a scanner in a gallery or public space, therefore combining on-line users with visitors to the exibhition. This installation was presented on September 21, 2001 at Banff Centre's The Other Gallery, and will be shown at the event ""Barcelona Digital"", Barcelona May 2002, and in an exhibit curated by Claudia Giannetti in the Centro Multimedia, Centro Nacional de las Artes, Mexico City, in June 2002.>>TECHNOLOGIEHumanos uses a flash 5.0 front-end, combined with a back-end usage of my sql, perl, and vectorizing software in a linux environment.

From an aerial view the Ringbahn has the shape of a dog's head, and so it is colloquially known as ""Hundekopf"", German for ""dog's head"". The Ringbahn is an integral component of the city's transportation network, and its restoration into a complete circle after the fall of the Berlin Wall has given it symbolic significance among Berliners. From the Ringbahn windows riders can gain an incomplete perspective of the city as a whole, and Berlin's TV tower (the city's most iconic landmark) is always within sight. Knifeandfork uses the Ringbahn as a literal vehicle for moving through a text-message based narrative that investigates the nature of private experience in public space. The piece begins with flyers, distributed throughout Berlin, that contain the emblem of a resistance organization and instructions on how to join it. After text-messaging the name of a Ringbahn station to the phone number printed on the flyer, the participant receives a message with instructions to board a specific train which will be arriving in the next few minutes. Hundekopf has a unique approach to location awareness. Individual trains are tracked via the station arrival times published in realtime on the the BVG (Berlin's transit authority) website. Once the participant is on a train, his or her location can therefore be determined without the use of advanced locative technology. Using a GSM modem, the Hundekopf system delivers a message to participants after each station they pass on their way around the Ringbahn. This message is place specific, and there is a certain cinematic quality to the piece as the ordinarily passive features of the landscape are put into a new context. One of Hundekopf's primary goals was to build a narrative structure derived from the specific physical structure of the environment. What emerged was dubbed a 'hub narrative' because it is not tied together by a series of events; instead it is anchored by the central axis of the TV tower. There is no beginning and no end, so the messages remain coherent regardless of where the participant enters the narrative. Additionally, the theme of resistance was central to the piece, a resistance against de facto modes of inhabiting public space. The messages sent to the participant outlined a Situationist-inspired manifesto, tactics for experiencing the environment within and without of the train in a novel and provocative light. This theme was mirrored by the process of creating the piece. Knifeandfork incorporated as many publicly available resources as possible: for example, the entire piece was conceptualized and programmed in Berlin's cafes using public Wi-Fi. Furthermore, however, Hundekopf hacks the BVG website and the Berlin transit system itself--which are of course open to the public--and in doing so the piece acts in a way that is both performative and subversive. With Hundekopf, Knifeandfork is interested in manipulating the narrative structures latent in architecture and the urban environment. The piece seeks to interject the poetic into the everyday, with the idea that creative experience should be integrated--not isolated--from the movements of everyday life.",6/20/05 0:00,http://knifeandfork.org/hundekopf,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,Date created: 2005-06-20,6/20/05 0:00,,,"Berlin, BVG, Conceptual, contextual, GSM, identity, installation, interact, live, Mobile, Narrative, non linear, Participatory, performance, privacy, public space, resistance, Ringbahn, SMS, social space, space, surveillance, text-messaging, trains"3545,Hybrid Architecture Research,Saskia,Vandersee,Saskia Vandersee,"ConnectedSpaces is an experimental architectural project about the use of evolutionary computing methodologies and the internet, which are used to create emergent hybrid environments between places and non-places--real and virtual, public and private.

R.,Carpenter,J. R. Carpenter,"in absentia is a web-based writing project that addresses issues of gentrification and its erasures in the Mile End neighbourhood of Montreal. The work combines HTML, javascript and the Google Maps API to create an interactive non-linear narrative of interconnected ‚Äúpostcard‚Äù stories written from the point of view of former tenants of Mile End forced out by gentrification. This project features new fiction in both English and French by J. R. Carpenter with guest authors: Lance Blomgren, Andy Brown, Daniel Canty, Alexis O‚ÄôHara and Colette Tougas. New stories will continue to be be added into the all of 2008.n absentia is a Latin phrase meaning ‚Äúin absence.‚Äù I‚Äôm drawn to the contradiction inherent in being in absence. In recent years many long-time low-income neighbours being forced out of Mile End by economically motivated decisions made their absence. So far fiction is the best way I‚Äôve found to give voice these disappeared neighbours, and the web is the best place I‚Äôve found to situate their stories. Our stories. My building is for sale; my family may be next. Faced with imminent eviction I‚Äôve begun to write about the Mile End as if I‚Äôm no longer here, and to write about a Mile End that is no longer here. By manipulating the Google Maps API, I am able to populate ‚Äúreal‚Äù satellite images of my neighbourhood with ‚Äúfictional‚Äù characters and events. I aim to both literally and figuratively map the sudden disappearances of characters, fictional or otherwise, from the places, real or imagined, where they once lived; to document traces people leave behind when they leave a place, and the stories that spring from their absence. in absentia is a web ‚Äúsite‚Äù haunted by the stories of former residents of Mile End, a slightly fantastical world that is already lost but at the same time is still fully known by its inhabitants: a shared memory of the neighbourhood as it never really was but could have been.Themes of place and displacement pervade my fiction and electronic literature, yet place long remained an abstract, elusive notion for me. Perhaps because for many years I wrote about long ago places attempting to inhabit pasts that could never be mine. Mapping the minutia of my most immediate surroundings has made my notion of place less abstract and more socially engaged. Writing about my neighbours has made me aware that I write from amongst them, thus engendering a ""we"" point of view. Increasingly, my work is collaborative. In in absentia (June 2008) I join a cast of writers from my neighbourhood to pen ""postcards"" to and from former tenants, fictional or otherwise, displaced by gentrification and it's erasures.in absentia also marks the end of DARE-DARE's Dis/location: projet d'articulation urbaine in the Mile End's parc sans nom.

Dealing with mediated spaces, existences and space interpretations. Focusing on transforming the primarily visual digital environment into a physical and tactile experience, finding an architectural and tectonic embodiment.Here we are presenting three constructed architectural prototypes discussing the above questions; built metaphorical structures that bring together these design aspects. Hybrid constructions, architectural models, engineered structures, electronics and media design, all combined to create the experiments.On the threshold of architecture, media design, engineering we try to talk about a new and different relationship between technology and design. The role and effect of technology reveals a more profound relation between design and design tools, and to quote Vil√©m Flusser here: we try to ""turn the automatic apparatus against automation"".Prototyping architecture -Engineering mediaTo find these new qualities we rely on experiments and testing on a 1 to 1 scale. Even if building installations has physical limits in scale, the hybrid experience becomes real.The physical structures have mathematical and computational inner logics, results of algorithmic processes based on our decisions; they are generated and processed forms. They have to function as physical structures as well as projected structures.The projections become volumetric, the physical structures are dissolved in the flux of interactive media, and media become actual and spatial. New qualities emerge that do not come from the physical structure or from the media, these qualities are result of a symbiosis. The interaction we create is symbolic, it is not really trying to function or process information, but to transform the physical entity in a non physical way. While contemporary interaction design usually takes on a very generic form, object, and invents a very unique interaction, we go from the other end; we create structures and materiality that are unique with their hybrid logic of being a media space as well as an architectural structure, but in our case the interaction model is more generic.",8/15/04 0:00,http://www.aether.hu/inductionhouse/index.html,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: mediated spaceDate created: 2004-08-15",8/15/04 0:00,,,"Adam Somlai-Fischer, aether architecture, Anita Pozna, artificial life, Barcelona, Bengt Sj√É¬∂l√É¬©n, Budapest, design, Flash, Formalist, Generative, Helsinki, HTML, immersion, installation, interact, mediated spaces, offline, Participatory, Peter Hudini, space, Stockholm, Telematic"46951,infinity,Mai Yamashita,#NAME?,Mai Yamashita + Naoto Kobayashi,"""Paths are made by walking""In order to determine whether the above phrase was actually true, Yamashita and Kobayashi kept running in a park for 5 days.In the fast-forward movie compiled from digital photographs taken one per second, a path the shape of ‚àû (infinity) gradually emerges as they move with high-speed.",7/16/07 0:00,http://www.yamashita-kobayashi.com/infinity.html,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,,7/16/07 0:00,,,"art world, Collaborative, Conceptual, film, HDV/16:9/silent/4:38min.

Our sensitivity to the mechanical gesture confirms our affinities with the inanimate. We are the becoming thing of animality. ...This machinic will is somehow responsible for not only the end of the juridical regime of which it is the center, but for the alteration of language: its instrumentalization. It takes, it seems, the presence of a machine to effect this cruel transformation. While the working of the machine on the body of the condemned models the direct transformation of people by technical activity, the sheer presence of the machine, the mere witness of its operations, has transformative properties as well. There is a contagion of automatic functioning that extends from the machine to those in its attendance.Inscription is an exploration of the aesthetics of power in relation to the task of writing. Here, in a time when the neo-fascist spirit is casting a shadow across the political culture, and when the possibility of meaningful political discourse seems more and more remote because of it, there is a relationship between the wealth of violenceÔøΩwar, images of brutalityÔøΩand the poverty of our communications. There is a relationship between the denigration of thoughtfulness as weakness, femininity, and gayness, and the impossibility of halting the campaign of aggression that the U.S. has embarked on, or of furthering stalled progress in the domain of civil rights or economic justice.Schwarzenegger's moronically effective hypermasculine politics has made a figure of perverted masculinity a rallying cry of the right: girly-man, that blatantly homophobic and misogynistic epithet.

There is no consciousness of the offence commited by casting the insulted traits in the feminine.In this context, Inscription triangulates the relationship between body and language as evidenced in the perspectives of Kafka, Foucault, and SchwarzeneggerÔøΩbetween literature, philosophy, and politics, between mind, machine, and human, between poetry, art, and architecture.",5/20/05 0:00,http://www.onetwothree.net/borevitz/image/projects/inscription/inscription.html,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/42813/borevitz_inscription.pdf,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: politicsComments from user: The work is a robotic installation.

Of course, over time, I couldn't help but notice that some of the most ingenious and cutting edge website technology (for better or worse) are being used by the porn industry.  Porn dominates net traffic.One day I was surfing around, looking through some hack sites and my browser got attacked by a bunch of porn push ads.  Nothing new about that, the underworld (underground?) connections of hack and porn are far-reaching. I was surprised this time however, that the ads wanted me to view some 'incest pics'.  Suddenly I discovered a web of 'incest' sites, which seemed to me a pretty effective way to repackage ordinary porn as something even more forbidden.I was particularly impressed by the imaginative phrasings the site's anonymous creators came up with. So, by changing a few words around I tried to usurp the power of their dirty imaginations for a wholesome purpose.A lot of my work comes from the enquiry into how to use technologies of mass-control for artistic/liberating purposes. These 'incest sites' promised an enormous amount of content, yet clicking around, I found most of the links brought one to the same place.

A Klein bottle is a geometric object that has inside and out, but consists of a single surface. Construction of the Klein bottle is usually described as the process of deforming an ordinary bottle by bending the neck around, putting it through the side and connecting it to an opening in the bottom. The Klein bottle is essentially a 3-D representation of a 4-d object. In building the model for this project I discovered a very simple, elegant and apparently new construction of a Klein bottle from two tori. Once I had created the model I animated a voyage into and through it. From this animation I extracted 12 frames which I combined with text to create the conceptual piece which will be reproduced as a series of limited edition archival quality prints.

The machine uses virtual reality to act on physical reality and is only effective in my current apartment: 5, Placeta de Montcada. This is so because my living space is at the core of this particular experiment - an experiment which allows net users to participate in it at both levels, virtual and real. That is, anyone may step into my apartment reproduced on a web page and, at the same time, make his/her presence felt in the physical flat by animating certain objects in the place. A printed stainless steel ground-plan of the apartment is mounted on the vertical panel of the switchboard installed in the flat. This plan is reproduced in the web page more elaborately: it contains a longitudinal section and a ground-plan. These two plans include some 450 photographs of every piece of furniture and every single object in the apartment. The navigator or, in this case, the intruder uses a virtual man in order to walk around the virtual apartment, but as we stated earlier, in doing so he/she will physically make his/her presence felt at the other end. He/She may do this in a number of ways.  For instance, the minute the intruder enters the virtual flat and starts moving around, whoever is in the flat will be able to verify where he/she is located at any given moment by following the luminous signals on the original plan mounted on the switchboard. If the intruder wishes to communicate with someone at the flat, he/she may send a typed message which a virtual male voice will reproduce at the other end. One of six telephones connected to the switchboard - placed in the kitchen, the entrance, the living room, the studio and two bedrooms - will ring in the room where the navigator is located while sending his/her message. To ensure that every call is received, a reel-to-reel recorder placed on the table of the switchboard will act as an answering machine and record the messages. In addition to this, while moving around the virtual apartment the user will discover he/she is listening to a piece of music which can only be heard properly if he/she positions him-/herself at the center of the apartment. In any of the other spaces, one of the instruments in the musical composition will stand out over the others. Also, the intruder may turn the lights in the apartment on and off at will, as well as activate radios and other electronic devices. He/she is also invited to walk into my studio and obtain detailed information about my work and other recent works created in collaboration with Mohammad Mobaseri.

In essence these signs and how we interpret them allow us to create and define the norm and who we are as individuals and as a group. Herein is the documentation of the solo show Interpreted, Obscured and Sought that opened in Gallery 148, March 2005, at Minneapolis College of Art and Design.

Two projectors are suspended over-head in the center of the gallery with a computer that synchronizes and randomly selects a video clip of the pitcher and receiver.

This way a virtual map is produced in which an autogenic network space is described, somewhat like a spatial map of a virtual internet space. The starting point of this endeavor is a website ( for example: www.rhizome.com ). All users, who are connected to this website, respectively their IP-numbers influence the network project in real time, and their data is utilized for the advancement of the process.

Their appearance is a direct abstraction from the numeric values in their IP address. Each time someone visits the project, an icon is made and added to the collection.Each segment of an IP address pertains to a certain property of its corresponding icon. Since each segments numeric value is between 0 and 255, it is an 8-bit byte. This is the same range of values used to describe color to a computer. The first segment is red, the second segment is green, and the third segment is blue. This establishes the color of the icon.The fourth segment is the byte that determines the pattern for the given icon. Since the segment is an 8-bit number, it can be translated into its binary equivalent, which is a series of eight 0‚Äôs and 1‚Äôs.

A wireless version was released in August of 2002 with the support of a commission from Rhizome, and debuted in a four-day workshop at Eyebeam gallery in New York. At this event, the IAA collaborated with the Surveillance Camera Players to use iSee to document hundreds of CCTV cameras in several New York neighborhoods. These cameras were displayed on a large map in the gallery space, promoting dialog with the public about privacy, surveillance, and public space.iSee has provoked public debate over CCTV use in such publications as Wired Magazine, the London Financial Times, and BusinessWeek and on websites including Slashdot and Fox News. iSee is also featured on Yahoo's ""Travel and Transportation"" guide to New York City. iSee  has also been exhibited at Princeton University, Brown University, and the New Museum (New York).

The underlying algorithm works like a looped magnetic tape where incoming images will merge with oldermaterials and be influenced by the older recordings' magnetic memory. Due to the random nature of its making the piece usually needs a few minutes to accumulate enough material in order to show its full potential.The stream of images starts with some random image has just been added to flickr and continues by following the trail of tags the images themselves create. Each image downloaded tries to share at least one tag with the previous one. This rule leads to varying rhythms in the narrative - sometimes the story seems to get stuck for minutes in a thematic dead end but then suddenly it wanders off into a completely different direction.All camera pans, blends, effects and glitches are induced randomly and also influenced by Oleg Marakov's soundtrack which is in itself randomly arranged from a library of sound samples and melodic elements. The samples are used like notes and are therefore prepared in different lengths. Also the pauses in between the notes are part of the composition. Islands Of Consciousness creates an infinite movie in realtime from images that it continously retrieves randomly from flickr.com. The selection of images is not entirely random though - every image shares at least one tag with the previously loaded and due to this restriction the movie develops a stream-of-consciousness esthetic and appears to follow a narrative structure. It also develops its own rhythm - sometimes the story seems to get stuck in a thematic dead end for minutes only to escape it into some completely unexpected direction. A very important part in this piece is the soundtrack by the Ukrainian composer Oleg Marakov. In this piece sound samples are used like notes and get randomly arranged in realtime. This means that the soundtrack will always be different and the probability for it to ever repeat are very small.

The basic idea is to launch a fake virus that affects the computer and human kind. The virus is constructed out of language. The gosipp about the fake virus is a virus itself.The web page is mainly in Serbian. English translation to be released soon.English text about the project on http://www.kontrola.co.yu/jobst.htm Kontrola is an Internet based artwork dealing with viruses. The starting point for the work is a common assumption that computer viruses and human viruses are from two different systems. The goal was to find/create a virus that affects both computers and humans. The common denominator of computer and human systems is language, therefore the virus of Kontrola is linguistic.In practical terms, the real virus used in this project is a lie, rumour or a gossip.The course of the project:1 I as the author founded an imaginary institution called Kontrola, which deals with Internet security. During the first part of the project, a web page, www.kontrola.co.yu, provided basic information about a new virus that was supposedly spreading over the internet. An email with information about the Babel/Rrose virus was sent to thousands of email addresses in Serbia from Kontrola. It said that the recipient's computer is probably infected by the Babel/Rrose virus (which is a disinformation or a lie). The name of the virus consists of two parts: Babel (allusion to the Babylonian tower and the language confusion) and Rrose (Marcel Duchamp's female alter ego, Rrose Selavy). The fictional virus was supposedly intelligent and functions within the language of the computer user. Sometimes it just scrambles the text on the computer, but sometimes it changes the meaning of the text.2 In the next wave of emails, the text of the email was scrambled a bit, as if it was affected by the virus itself.

The images from these three incidents are put under the light of historical context, thus juxtaposing our present with our past.

The site is designed and managed by Yuri Ono. The propelling mechanism behind this work is http://www.learningtoloveyoumore.com. Visitors to the site will find a growing list of assignments such as:  -Re-create three minutes of a NPR Fresh Air interview. -Make a documentary video about a small child. -Start a lecture series in your town. Anyone can go to the site, accept an assignment, complete it by following the simple but specific instructions, send in the required report (photograph, CD, video, etc), and see evidence of  their work posted on-line. With energetic outreach the website reaches people and institutions that are not usually called upon to create or are under-funded with regard to art: schools, prisons, senior centers, corporations, etc. The project ideas reflect the sensibility of Fletcher and July, but ultimately provide clear and simple channels through which the participant's own life experience can be channelled. Like a recipe, meditation practice, or familiar song, the prescriptive nature of these assignments allows the participant to focus less on creativity and more on feeling and experience. The resulting art is surprising and good. LEARNING TO LOVE YOU MORE EXHIBITSIn addition to the assignments given by Fletcher and July, the web site has several different sections which are updated every few months. We invite you to visit the site and investigate the sections entitled FRIENDS, HELPING, and LOVE. The section called DISPLAYS will document Learning to Love You More exhibitions in museums, galleries, schools, senior citizens centers, radio shows and film festivals. The shows are comprised of work that July and Fletcher select from the web site for the particular exhibit. Chosen artists are asked to mail their piece to the site of the show (with a self-addressed stamped packaging for return.)  All exhibits will be unique; the project allows for an unusual amount of flexibility. Here are just a few possible approaches: -Assignments can be given in advance of the show which ask participants to respond to some detail of the region where the show will be. -Assignments can be given in advance of the show which are only available to a specific demographic: residents of a particular town or treatment facility, employees of a chosen institution, people of a certain age or race. These limitations may or may not be relevant to the exhibiting institution. -Some exhibits may be sponsored by an art institution but are installed at a non-art facility. For example MoMA presents Learning to Love You More, hosted by Public School 65.  -Some exhibits may be all video (a screening or installation) or all sound (a broadcast), or may draw from just one or two assignments. -Some exhibits may be curated by guest curators, such as yourself, or Julie Hecht.The variations are limitless and all of them are simple to facilitate.  In some cases Fletcher and/or July can administer the exhibition remotely; in other cases the show will be presented in conjunction with a residency, lecture, screening, performance or exhibit of Fletcher or July's own work. A pilot for this project was launched in June 02, in connection with an exhibit at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Maine. The project has received generous support from the Creative Capital Foundation and has been redesigned for unlimited use. Exhibitions are now being scheduled.

Increasingly, we see nature and technology merging in unprecedented ways; from the robotic and digital pets available in toy stores to the convincingly simulated animals and plants in movies. I am interested in the personal experiences and emotions motivated by this overlap of nature and technology. In my work, I create these moments in several different ways. In one form, I take a naturally occurring phenomenon, like the flight pattern of birds, or the way water drops roll down a window pane, and first use computer algorithms to create a digital imitation of it. Once I have achieved a realistic simulation, I manipulate these algorithms, modifying the phenomenon to create a magical or surreal experience. I also take a more sculptural approach, using inanimate objects to make creatures with needs and demands. I add robotic elements to both repurposed and handmade objects, giving them voices and personalities. Through tactile and audio interactions with the objects, users develop immediate emotional bonds which can take many forms, such as tenderness, repulsion and joy. In a third manner, I use existing and customized video editing software to deconstruct theatrical elements of cinema, such as time and choreography, to create allegorical new works with a painterly and a poetic sensibility. These pieces often begin with existing popular films and, while retaining clues as to their identity, isolate and emphasize one or more formal filmic element by using it as an artistic tool. I also use my own footage and create looped video narratives that address such issues as creation, faith, and doubt. In each form, my work addresses the way people perceive and relate to their surrounding world and the myriad images populating the contemporary landscape. By taming and redefining natural phenomenon through programming, projection and imbuing inanimate objects with human characteristics, my work aims to create transcendent experiences that make viewers more aware of their mutable surroundings.

This resulting 'poem' can be sent as eMail from the Log and be used for further textual changes, simple archiving or as a  further reference point amidst existential confusion. With this work, I wanted to extend the use of fragmented browser windows as a formal and visual means to break apart narrative sequences.

Carousels gained popularity as childrens's rides despite their orignal militaristic origin which gives them a an unacknowledged Grimmesque sinister aspect.War games such as jousting tournaments later developed into carousels which currently exists for us as rides and now possibly as interactive inhabitants of virtual reality posessing artificial intelligence. In addition to horses, menagerie animals represented desirable characteristics needed for battle. All photographs were taken of actual rides on New York‚Äôs upper west side from 70-110th street, including a historic carousel at 65th street and Central Park West (Stein and Goldstein 1908) over a period of several years. Most of the rides are now gone. The music ‚ÄúFour Burlesques for Flute and Bb Clarinet‚Äù, by my father Dr. Irwin Swack (published by Shawnee Press) is reminiscent of medieval masque plays. Currently the video can be presented in 2D on a plasma screen or projected on a large wall. ""Carousel"" is also being adapted for a 3D possibly interactive immersive environment using Maya. Ideally I would like to create a curved room like structure where life size 3D carousel images would be continuously projected moving in a circular fashion around the room. Additionally ""Carousel"" can be made interactive so that the animals follow human movement and perhaps incorporate elements of artificial intelligence.Initially created in 2001 from still photographic images that were digitalized and animated using Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Macromedia Director and later AfterEffects, Premiere and Protools .

The computational processes that take place are displayed on four LED arrays with a total number of 3000 white LEDs.Our work began with a question: what would happen if the surfaces that surrounds us were given memory. The installation has microphones recording fragments of human interaction. Each new recorded fragment is analysed using an adaptive sound categorization technique, determining its relation to previously stored clips.Based on this analysis, a network of sound clips is formed and reformed in real time. The network of recorded clips is constantly reorganized as new fragments are recorded and connections between previously stored clips are elaborated. The goal of the self-organization is to maintain a topology where fragments with similar perceptual qualities are grouped in clusters and dissimilar clips are separated from each other. As time goes by the network evolves into a rich mass of information with complex interconnections.Recomposed sequences of sound are played back into the space by walking through the network of sonic memories. The sounds overlap in time and space. They are distributed into the space based on a mapping from the network position to a position in the room.

All of this seems to point to a process that is an effective rendering of reality. But what if the photograph is actually the shadow of a reality that is beyond human ken?In a sense, one could say that a photograph is a thing that is not fully apparent. The making of a photograph, in other words, still 'is'. The photographic print/image exists, 'is' now, but it is disjointed and disconnected from the moment of its making by our inabilitiy to perceive of time as anything but a linear phenomenon.These images were made with that consideration. And the possibility that one could say the same about God. Or god, or the sacred. What if the face, that most central and highly nuanced signifier of personality, experience and expression, is also disjointed and disconnected from some deeper, more global personality, experience and expression? What if our perceptual limitations always keep us in that state of disconnectedness?  As I look at a photograph of a face, am I looking at the face? Is the face looking back at me, or through me, or I through it, or through the photographer? Is this experience of gazing muddying up experience itself and shifting what I know into something which becomes highly questionable, even chaotic?The greek gods, particularly Zeus, occasionally bestowed protection upon their mortal favorites by giving them a special shield, known as the aegis. Ultimately, it was often a shield that protected the mortal from mischief wrought by other gods.

This rather pragmatic analysis has led me to cognify a digitality in the the work that has become a formative part of my aesthetic of some, but not all works, specifically a body of works I am calling ""Volumetric Gestures"".The visual language of these works speaks in terms of the bitmap and the vector as well as form, line, gesture, and action; the aesthetic could be called ""digitalist"" perhaps, since ""digital"" simply describes a binary transcription.After completing a series of images working with 3D wireframe chalice forms, I was introduced by art historian Andrew Hershberger to the wireframe goblets of Paolo Ucello, hand-drawn in pencil with machinelike precision by the artist in 1450. This closed a circle for me, and made me realize the circularity and connectedness of time and thought.In the incorporation of technology-based art media in my studio practice, I feel there is a new modernism which I seek; one which escapes the postmodern loop and lives in the moment, a place beyond context. Data has been aestheticised, and aesthetics have been coded; we as artists are in a position of responsibility to leave some artifacts behind.

Encountering without attempting to assimilate, master, control or reject the other, everyday performane artworks draw on that part of the human psyche that evades commodification and resists colonisation.  love_potion is an everyday, distributed performance artwork in three phases that uses borage herbs, seeds, magic spells, aural-visual trans-narratives and DIY installations. There is no single focus to love_potion rather it weaves several elements together that simultaneously exist in different places and across different times. Some aspects of the work can be performed in a gallery whilst other aspects are performed at home. Knowledge and memories of one element are transported across to another and back again.love_potion uses only the most fragile protocols to draw attention to everyday performance spaces and situations.The first phase of the performance takes place over six months and involves seeding, tending, harvesting and drying borage herbs. It was first carried out by the artists as an everyday activity and subsequently transformed through repetition and ritual into a form that can be shared with others.The second phase involves preparing a magic potion from borage, an herb that reputedly drives away sorrow and melancholy, uplifts the spirits, and when shared with others nurtures compassion and peace.   For Bracha L. Ettinger 'compassion [..] works its way, like art does, by fine attunements that evade the political systems'.The third phase is where performers come together to co-create and co-tend an intimate place filled with aural-visual trans-narratives that can be downloaded from the glorious ninth website.  When performers leave the shared space they take with them borage flowers and seeds with the intention of making new intimate spaces to share with others.

Initially created for Eyebeam's arts and media Internet showdown, ""Contagious Media"" (May 19th - June 9th, 2005), Mail A Virus! was shut down by ISP Datagram within 72 hours of the project's broadcast due to a ""violation"" of the terms of service. The rules of entry for ""Contagious Media"" stipulated that each web submission be a new work, live, and hosted on the official Contagious Media Server, in compliance with the service provider's terms of use, with no adds , bots , scams or paid works permissible.  A portion of Datagram's official response to queries regarding the said ""violation"" reads: ""It's not really a question of our opinion of the site or how or what it is doing, it comes right down to the fact that these IP addresses can and have already begun to be black listed because someone may think you are sending viruses - even if you are not actually doing anything bad, you are setting off way too many alarm bells.

In such cases, improper punishment or penalties may ensue, all within a free and democratic society.

As people can upload the same shot more than once infinite versions of the film are possible. The work explores the capabilities of the internet to achieve global collaboration by encouraging culturally diverse participation and by developing software which accepts input from many sources (e.g. mobile phone, digital still camera, video, screen-grab) allowing for the greatest range of participation.To ensure that uploads would not be from the usual places 12 foreign correspondents were commissioned (Brazil, Lebanon, Israel, Columbia, Pakistan, Russia, Serbia, Japan, China, Korea, Mexico,Thailand) whose role is to spread the word through their mailing lists and to organize the upload of scenes or shots that add up to a minimum of one minute in length.Man With A Movie Camera was selected because of Vertov‚Äôs intentions as a filmmaker to document daily activities. The film itself is a database of shots. Although it is structured around a day from sunrise to sunset that day is synthesized using footage from three different cities and interrupted by a second narrative which is the diary in the life of a cameraman (a worker). It is edited in anything but a linear fashion using techniques as sophisticated as today‚Äôs video editing softwares. There are no shots longer than 22 seconds making it very contemporary in rhythm. The intention of the project is to orchestrate a fluid work that invites participation, that continues to grow after it is launched, and that results in a database of personal perspectives where evidence of politics and history is filtered through the lens of individual rather than state philosophies- in Vertov‚Äôs terms ‚Äúthe decoding of life as it is‚Äù. It is intended for the web, for screening in public space, theatres, film festivals, museums, galleries.In creating the database version Vertov‚Äôs experiment enters the 21st century. Its original form and content pose interesting questions about the nature of documentary that are still relevant almost a century later. Project HistoryOne of my persistent concerns is the question of access, the digital divide, who is included, who is left out. I am particularly interested in public space as a venue.In 2000 I set up a screen in the Staten Island Ferry Terminal Building in New York to present The Terminal Salon, a portrait of the community done in collaboration with local residents who shot all the video. I considered that a local channel. When we were testing the projection passersby asked how they could be on the screen and I had no way to do that. While I was working on The Terminal Salon I was invited to participate in VideoArchaeology in Sofia. I decided to reshoot four minutes of Man With A Movie Camera in collaboration with a Bulgarian artist, Boyan Dobrev, who wanted to learn about video. Sofia in 1999 was in a transition and I thought the parallel could be interesting.The footage we shot as very much a copy of the original leading me to question the possibilities of the remake. Putting those two experiences together led to my current project Man With a Movie Camera:The Global Remake. Man With a Movie Camera: The Global Remake is a participatory video shot by people around the world who are invited to record images interpreting the original script of Vertov‚Äôs Man With A Movie Camera, upload them to http://dziga.perrybard.net where software developed specifically for this project archives, sequences and streams the submissions as a film.

Mobile location aware narrative systems have significant potential when applied to urban spaces especially if disadvantaged. Such systems can empower communities by providing a forum in which they can express, recall and celebrate the culture and history of their neighbourhood, supporting perception of it as a place as opposed to simply a space. Kluitenberg definition of public domain as a social and cultural space characterized by commonly shared ideas and memories and the physical manifestations that embodies them inspired the conception of the the Media Portrait of the Liberties (MPL). The MPL embodies the intangible aspects of public domain: local community anecdotes and memories are captured in the form of multimedia fragments and redistributed through the neighbourhood real space. Through the use of mobile location aware technology, such as GPS enabled PDA‚Äôs, locals and non, can roam the neighbourhood streets and access stories and memories of the place. Each story is available in the specific locations where it happened and is networked with related anecdotes where similar facts of characters appear. People are taken on a journey through physical and historical space of the Liberties neighbourhood public domain. As a result, locals feel stimulated to recall anecdotes, engage in storytelling activity among themselves as well as with people not familiar with the area. Because they feel connected to the content regarding their own neighbourhood and their past and present lives, the experience boost the community members confidence in using technology for browsing as well as contributing to the pre-authored media stories database. The MPL authored centred approach to  community stories is designed to function as a story-catalyst for the local community and offers them a starting point, and inspiration to take ownership of the project and continue to develop its collection by contributing as authors to an ongoing story database rendering a grass roots history of the area.More details and project documentation can be found at: http://www.valentinanisi.com/liberties.html",12/11/05 15:42,https://www.cs.tcd.ie/~nisiv/liberties.html,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: locative media, distributed narrative, mobile technology, physical navigationDate created: 2004-12",12/11/05 15:42,,,"Around the Banks Of Pimlico, Collaborative, community, contextual, Documentary, Dublin Liberties, Glorianna Davenport, HTML, Ian Oackley, identity, immersion, installation, interact, Mads Haahr, MediaLabEurope MIT research Partner, memory, Narrative, offline, public space, QuickTime, social space, space, Trinity College Dublin, Visual"14360,Mediated Spaces,Adam,Somlai-Fischer,Adam Somlai-Fischer,"Mediated Spaces MSc in Architecture research project ""what we perceive as reality is a tiny detail from the field of possibilities surging around us, which our nervous system has realized through computation.

By reversing the usual use of java-scripted roll-overs, Memoirs promotes the playful exploration of  shifting imagery to the  primary work, and relegates the static images to the status of  links.This is a work which invites the viewer to experience the many choices and variations that are a part of composing any complex image. I am interested in the possibility of creating web works which go past the usual level of interactivity, and take the viewer into the realm of the undefinable and personal aesthetic experience, where the viewing experience evokes unique memories and associations. Still images can profoundly engage the viewer by presenting morsels of information and juxtaposing them against fully defined elements, and then inviting the viewer to go back in forth following visual links of color and/or similarity in form to enter into the thoughts and the experiences of the artist in a way which allows the viewer to claim these as personal. The trick here is for the viewer to understand the choices that the artist felt in making the work, and to experience the thrill of seeing many different images emerge out of the same source materials.The imagery is derived from my travels to sites which carry the vestiges of past lives, those special places where the visitor senses history and continuity beyond one's own life. ",8/18/01 0:00,http://CBRubin.net/memoirs,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/3041/memoirs/,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: sacred space, historyComments from user: work was produced with under an Individual Artist's Fellowship from the Connecticut Commission on the ArtsDate created: 2001-08-18Date cloned: 2013-02-07",8/18/01 0:00,,,"Animation, Brussells, cordoba, Cordoba Mosque, digital, Documentary, Flash, historical, HTML, identity, Java, memory, Narrative, New Haven, nostalgia, Orchard Street Synagogue, Participatory, space, St.Andrew's Cathedral, St.Andrews, Synagogue de Bruxelles, Visual"25534,Memolog,Tamar,Schori,Tamar Schori,"Memolog honors the memory of children, up to the age of 14, who have been murdered in terror attacks since the year 2000.

By combining strategies employed in web-based discussion forums, blogs , tele-text subtitling, on demand video streaming, and search engines, the open captioning format employed by Meta-CC will allow users to gain multiple perspectives and resources engaging current events. The Fox News Channel in the U.S. will be archived as our initial source material, but the system we are developing is adaptable for use with any cable news or television network.Meta-CC's system will separate a single video stream from the cable news source's line-21 closed caption element. The decoded text from the captions is used to create an archive of possible topics for debate/discussion, and cross referenced online to provide similar news stories from alternative news sources. As users view the captions and video, they may add their own search terms and additional online resources to the database. This information, combined with the topics being gleaned in real-time from the closed-caption stream, is used to create a news ticker superimposed upon the original video source, containing alternative commentary to the audio/video portion of the station being archived.As the archive grows, so do the different divergent topics and resources presented to the user. While responding to a particular news story, the Meta-CC engine may present a user with a list of alternative sources for information about that particular topic, along with portions of the archive deemed relevant by the engine to the present conversation.Meta-cc is in its infancy; as the project develops, additional features such as web-based remote channel switching, video archiving, and on-demand streaming of archived content will be implemented.Meta-CC is a work in progress.

Each image is unique and created for that instant in time. First the program loads a lookup table of color palettes from a database of palettes generated from actual artists works (Josef Albers for example). The engine then generates a 3d virtual world, populates it with primitive objects and assigns them shaders from the loaded palette. This handles of the general layout and also creates some volumetric shapes and lines that can work their way into the design. The program then extracts the image from the 3d objects. A decision tree determines how the image is deconstructed and reconstructed. The decision tree spawns graphic layers in memory much like layers in Photoshop and manipulates them before merging them into one image layer. The layered process iterates a couple of times arbitrarily choosing various manipulations, systemic reductions and effects. All resulting layers are arbitrarily assigned a stacking order and then they are merged. Finally vector shapes are drawn in the foreground and the graphic generation process is complete. When the graphic processes are complete, the The Micro Modernist creates a title by combining a noun, an adjective and a random number attempting in futility to assign meaning to the work.

Who is Finnish? What are the symbols of Finland? How has the image of Finland changed? And who defines it? The expedition travelled by a biodiesel car that was packed with five artists and protagonist of the project; a stuffed reindeer Paavo that was searching for new members to its herd. Reindeer is a symbol in the project for Finnish culture. For many foreigners and even for Finnish people Finland is a land of technology or a land of traditional culture. Nokia cell-phones might be a symbol of technology and maybe a reindeer is a symbol of traditional culture. Finland is marketed with Sami people, Lappish culture and nature. You can buy Sami costumes, reindeer skin, what ever you can think of in market square in Helsinki. People say they are proud of forests, thousands lakes, fells and ‚Äúsisu‚Äù. But what is really happening? Finnish people are forced to move to South in order to get a job, villages are getting empty in North and it is discussed if the whole Finland should be populated at all. Money is the key issue of course. It is expensive to offer public services to all small villages. And it is more expensive to have a reindeer herder than to have a stuffed reindeer in front of a souvenir shop. mikroPaliskunta is a series of interdisciplinary expeditions exploring nation(alism) and eco-social changes in the society, but is basically defined by the people or artists taking part of the travels.  Reindeer carries the symbol value that all the participants relate to. It is a over-used mascot of tourism, symbol of nation, mythic totem and an important production animal to reindeer herders.

This is his story-- as captured in photographs, audio tracks, and journal entries. I was shut in my kitchen for a week.  I bought all the stuff that I needed and put it in the kitchen.  A person (who I trusted) shut me in the room.  I also shot a video tape and photos as documentation. I was connected to the web in perpetual forum but couldn't talk or phone anyone, except for emergencies. The whole documentation (video, sounds and polaroid photos) was exhibited in December 2000 at the Interno & Dum Dum Art Gallery, via S.

Previous, I had relied on my passion for composition.  However, I hadn't been able to keep the motivation to make music steadily. I felt a lack of inspiration. This caused an unending cirlcle of frustration. Apathy or illness?  I attempted under compulsion!  I bound myself to making music...The performance ended on October 19th, 2000.

The illusion of life is very difficult to create, even when the underlying mechanisms are simple. Unless the illusion is particularly convincing, almost anyone can see through it - it seems hardwired into our cognition. I attempt to simulate this living quality in my work and to generate in the viewer a gut sense of recognition, yet also to question and undermine it. I am also interested in the experience of viewing artwork, and try to explore and subvert a viewer‚Äôs expectations: are they seeing the object, or is the object seeing them? In my work I try to create a sudden, destabilizing reaction: is it revulsion, delight, surprise? When an image reacts to its observer, how does the observer react to the image?

An artist's edition of five game cartridges has also been created.About this workRhizome.org announced a call for commission proposals to examine the nature of ‚Äúgame‚Äù art in 2004. In response to that call, I offered that I would be interested in examining the meaning of game as it relates to the hunt. Thus, I spent my time in the field, walking off-trail looking, searching, hunting for lost bits of bone, fragments of fur and other forgotten animal relics which are incorporated within this piece that exists both online and as a physical installation.The relics are contained within a virtual reliquary taking the form of a computer file native to game cartridges for Gameboy Advance (GBA) that can be viewed online within a browser window or downloaded to any actual GBA hardware. In this way, the relics can be viewed online or taken away by anyone who would like to download them, although to view them offline requires a GBA or GBA software emulator. Accompanying the relics are the field notes of the curator of the reliquary that also exist within the context of a web page.In addition to the online aspects of this work, a physical installation also exists consisting of a GBA with the reliquary preloaded onto it as well as a leather-bound book containing the field notes of the curator of the reliquary. This book is composed of handset, letter pressed type on Rives lightweight book paper; it is case bound and the book block is covered in soft calfskin leather. Viewers are allowed to peruse both the book and the GBA freely - as the book and the interface of the GBA are inviting and familiar, viewers tend to inherently gravitate toward examining both.

It consists of a proposal for a counter-monument, a campaign to gain support for the proposal, a website, an exhibition and a series of articles published in art magazines. The website http://trialerror.org was developed out from a need to channel some of the discussions and research made in relation to the project. Can public art be democratic? Should monuments exist forever? Who is the sender and who is the receiver in this very special kind of mass communication? Monuments in general tend to stir up strong emotions and debates. This monument in particular points to the need of getting real when dealing with complex questions related to national identity, representaion and the use of public space ‚Äì its democratic, symbolic and commercial aspects. To get real we sometimes need to make mistakes. We decided to get real. We listened to the arguments in the heated debate, and then presented a proposal for how to positively transform the controversial monument into a ‚ÄùMonument for the Masses‚Äù.  Being in Tallinn as a foreigner during three months in 2005 it was impossible not to receive knowledge about ""Kalevipoeg"", the protagonist of the Estonian national epic. The epic was written by F. R. Kreutzwald in a romantic, nationalistic tradition in mid 1800s. In late 1990s artist Tauno Kangro proposed a monument in the sea depicting ""Kalevipoeg"" -  as a Tallinn counterpart to the Statue of Liberty. He has gained support among politicians and found businessmen willing to sponsor his 21-meter bronze sculpture (one of which has acted as the model for the statue), but he met strong opposition among a larger part of the cultural elite. The project has caused a fierce debate, grand statements and much confusion. Is it good? Is it bad? Is it the wrong location, a faulty representation, an occupation of public space by private capital, a marvellous gift, the perfect symbol of the city of Tallinn or just a huge stupid mistake?In the online project ‚ÄùMonument for the Masses‚Äù we use the Kalevipoeg monument as a starting point to investigate monuments as a phenomenon and the rituals surrounding art in public spaces. At the website you find articles about how national heroes are constructed; French identity-soup; nation branding; the privatisation of public space; ruin value; the protests among the Taino people against a monument to Columbus in Puerto Rico and much more. Online it is also possible to contribute to the Park for Un/Wanted Public Expressions. This virtual sculpture park has been inspired by the Szobor Park in Hungary and can be seen as a growing archive of values by which we judge art, architecture and other expressions in different public spaces. Visit the park here: http://trialerror.org/Park/un-wanted.htmlBelow follows an excerpt from the article ‚ÄúSome Day They‚Äôre Gonna Name A Street After Me‚Äù by Holmstedt and Hagstr√∂m, published in Estonian Art no 2:2006. The full article is available online at: http://trialerror.org/writing/EA_no2_2007.htmlMiwon Kwon refers in her article ‚ÄúPublic Art as Publicity‚Äù [1] to an alternative way to look at art in the public sphere. Instead of genres, she suggests that we should consider art as different forms of publicity - that is, as different forms of communicative practices. One first comes to think of marketing and media attention, but more importantly in this context it refers to what in German is called ‚Äú√ñffentlichkeit‚Äù; how issues of concern are communicated, made available and handled in society.Kwon describes four modes of communicative practices: authoritarian, paternalistic, commercial and democratic. Estonians have a long and visible experience of the authoritarian model from Soviet times. Swedes are well acquainted with the paternalistic attitude of ‚Äútrust us, we know what is best for you‚Äù. The commercial mode of communication offers an alternative to state control through the freedom of choice on a free market, but another kind of power structure instead reveals itself based on profitability and access to different media. The general public also tends to be defined as consumers rather than citizens. A democratic practice though, opposes both state control and commercialism and aims to maximize individual participation. In reality all these different modes of communication are more or less mixed, but the perspective offered nevertheless helps us to think about art and its functions in new ways. Art seen as a communicative practice rather than an object also highlights the fact that the means of distribution you choose is part of the message you send. A huge statue will be erected in the bay of Tallinn and a competition has been announced in order to find the most suitable design. The competition, on the subject of the Estonian National Epic, is initiated by politicians and will be judged by politicians. This could be described as an example of a paternalistic and commercial attitude, disguised as a democratic mode of communication. Open competitions, as this one, are a clever way to make artists work for free according to your own agenda. Those who do not respond the correct way are disqualified. So what are the options here? To abide by the written (and unwritten) rules of monument making, to make visible the game-rules at work, to boycott the whole thing or to infiltrate? How do you choose your fights and where should they be fought?In our own project ‚ÄúMonument for the Masses‚Äù we propose a monument for the city of Tallinn. We ask ourselves if it is possible to think in terms of a democratic mode of communication dealing with power manifestations such as monuments. Are monuments about art, politics, tourism, national identity, collective memory or a group of individuals who for different reasons want to ‚Äúwrite history‚Äù? And, last but not least, what is our common responsibility to write alternative histories?[1] ‚ÄúPublic Art as Publicity‚Äù published in: Simon Sheikh (Ed.), In the Place of the Public Sphere?

At that time Toronto was becoming new home to me. While looking through the repository of local artifacts, I came across a pile of old photographs. I bought about twenty group portraits and put them on the shelf close to my kitchen table. My friends thought that the people on the photographs were my family. I wouldn't correct them. On the contrary, it was fun to name the strangers and to make up stories about their lives. Before very long I realised that the pictures from the junk store replaced in my memory the images of my relatives left behind in my country of origin. Based on that experience My Family is intended to emphasize fragility of human memory. At the same time, the work reflects on documentary qualities of digitally produced documents. While visiting this website, one has to complete a data search-like procedures and make choices. These actions will determine the factual elements of the stories and the appearance of the photographic material.In terms of structure and contents, My Family is an online interactive mirror of  Brothers and Sisters, an exhibition of paper based photography and text. Both works comprise the same photographs and real stories combined into ambiguous statements. Even though each piece has a life on its own and neither is  a prerequisite to the other, experiencing My Family in proximity to Brothers and Sisters intensifies the sense of loss caused by the fact that the progress of digital technologies has deprived us of photographic image and written text as tangible documents of our lives. ",9/4/01 0:00,http://myfamily.5tk.net/,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,Date created: 2001-09-04,9/4/01 0:00,,,"Animation, archive, Conceptual, Database, disappearance, Flash, Generative, identity, language, memory, Narrative, Text, Toronto"52701,My Generation,,,Eva and Franco Mattes aka 0100101110101101.org,My Generation is a video collage of kids freaking out while playing videogames.

Such as the power of advertising and the pervasive influence of media on our minds, the consumerism of pharmaceutical products and the purchase of entertainment. It explores the idea of constructing one‚Äôs identity based on the acquisition of images and pre-formulated models of being, resulting on an increased lack of self-understanding. Nanodramas is presented as a product line, with product names such as ‚ÄúPink War‚Äù, ‚ÄúNature‚Äù and ‚ÄúRubber Candy‚Äù.

An artificial identity is crafted by feeding one‚Äôs inner void with nanodramas.

Information Theory, which strictly concerns itself with the encoding and transmission of data, is displaced into the context of a literary narrative. This framing serves to evoke question surrounding the dispersion of Information Theory and other paradigms of first-wave cybernetics into contemporary culture.The source text, narratives from Project Gutenberg (http://www.gutenberg.org/), are treated as a message source. In terms of the Narrative Units system, the text displayed in white is noise. The system matches a particular string of symbols which correspond to a set of definitions from an introductory text on Information Theory. Matching words are displayed in red, and placed in one of the lower panels of the visualization.The pairing of a highly formalized, and technical set of concepts and fictional narratives complicate the distinction between different aspects of language and communication. Language as a set of discreet symbols which encode some content is subject to the manipulations of formal logic systems. Language as the medium for non-linear, non-rational narrative communication is another thing entirely.The ambiguous relationships between narrative, language and formal theories about communications are further explored in video. Each video sequence represents a simplified noun verb combination, 'open door,' 'descend stairs,' etc. This formula is designed to address the point at which two discreet pieces of information (a verb and a noun, 'open' and 'door' for example) combine into the flow of a narrative. The frame-rate of the video sequences is controlled by the text matching part of the system. As a result, the flow of the video is also complicated by the perceptible presence of it's discrete components (frames).Narrative Units in isolation is software system that manipulates and displays data. The inputs (literary narratives) and the larger system that results from it's presentation to an audience (especially in the context of the conventions of film and literature) tests the boundaries between data and narrative.The source code for Narrative Units is open source, and available for download here: http://code.google.com/p/narrativeunits/Link to video screen capture: http://static.ethanmiller.name/narrunits/narrunits_web.mov",10/15/06 0:00,http://ethanmiller.name/projects/narrativeunits/,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: narrativeDate created: 2006-10-15",10/15/06 0:00,,,"An Introduction to Information Theory, Animation, archive, audio, Conceptual, Database, digital, download, Ethan Miller, film, language, Narrative, Project Gutenberg, software, Text"47946,NEIGHBORHOOD [AN AUTOMATIC WRITING SUITE],Thomas,Knauer,Thomas Knauer,"I am drawn to the way words converge, how they bump against each other, deflect or intertwine.

By layering and meandering of pages from Alta Vista's ""bitch search"" with 313,375 pages found through Barbie's world, to Ljudmila and the Guggenheim Museum, the artist takes a hermeneutic approach to unraveling the hidden-yet-to-be-discovered world of net.art or net plasticism.  The ironically superficial title of Nice Page, is deeply rooted in Teo Spiller's previous projects ""Hommage to Mondrian"" and ""the banner art competition."" In Nice Page, the parallel drawn between net.art and neo-plasticism in Hommage to Mondrian is taken a step further right into the depths of the creative possibilities of the Internet. By layering and meandering of pages from Alta Vista's ""bitch search"" with 313,375 pages found through Barbie's world, to Ljudmila and the Guggenheim Museum, the artist takes a hermeneutic approach to unraveling the hidden-yet-to-be-discovered world of net.art or net plasticism. At first glance, Nice Page is a provocation toward the superficial flipping of pages and the over saturation of the Internet space. Above all, it is a criticism toward a superficial attitude in the approach to it. Referring to the practice of leafing through web pages, the artist positions himself against an easy way out in dealing with the phenomenon of protecting our mind from being constantly bombarded and cluttered during our cyber journeys. Weaving a medieval tapestry of ""illuminated"" pages, the artist interlaces them into a web demonstrating clearly how it could easily turn into a net for catching ""butterflies."" The Internet is shown as a beehive with fatal attractive powers as we spot here and there a queen bee or two, and of course much honey. However, the Page has two sides: the viewer is not seen as an innocent victim but rather as a thirsty-nice-page-hunter, aiming through the viewfinder-like frames within the frame. At the same time, Nice Page constitutes a filtering grid, a critical module of viewing. It brings us back to antiquity and takes on apotropaic functions. Its appeal acts as a protective shield against seductive and debilitating invasions of ""nice pages"" into our consciousness. The pleasant-looking mosaic acts as a bate leading the visitor to probe deeper and see what lies underneath the pavement, understand what is the hidden, underlying structure. In this strange mix of marbles (ital.), net.art is shown as a forum, an agora where questions can be asked and dialogues can take place. Surprisingly, as we navigate, there are moments when caught in the labyrinth of pages we loose track of the grid. Suddenly, there arises a desire to go back to the nice page and contemplated it further. Solving the riddle and deciphering the rules of the game which is about to unfold on this checkerboard seems to be the threshold to finding the essential links between the one traveling in cyber space and the journey itself. Spiller guides the viewer to a symbolic level of interactivity, where, by putting the pieces of this intricate puzzle together, one can arrive at touching with his/her own mind the contours of net.art as a whole. Probing the ground of net.art in intriguing and meaningful ways, Nice Page is a reflection on this art form, its true primary and neutral colours, tools and materials. It demonstrates Internet and net.art manners of ""pulling the strings,"" in one case to find an erring victim, in the other to arrive at a composition which can only be held by the mind because the artwork is only a springboard to our own, infinite imaginary world. Therefore, infinity, transparency, totality, interactivity, immateriality of the Net are illusory without the alert participation of the mind. ",4/10/00 0:00,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/2516/index.html,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/2516/index.html,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"Comments from user: don't be affraidDate created: 2000-04-10commented out line 17 of new_page_9.htm at artist's request.

Therefore, there is an important culture that lives in and for the copper mining camps, especially in the Atacama Desert. This culture has grown in what is called a ‚Äúcity assembly‚Äù, where the temporary meaning is present within the concept of welfare.The main body of my work is based on a six year documentation of the process of burying Chuquicamata, the biggest open-pit copper mining camp in the world, located in the north of Chile and the place where I lived 8 years of my early life. In this place, I could register and experiment, using photography, video, installations and collected objects, the social and topographic impact of the project of transferring its inhabitants, due to the growing mine and increased enforcement of pollution regulations.This people, so called ‚Äúnew neighbors‚Äù, have been affected by a change in the economic system under which they were used to live. A system that supported them in a sort of ‚Äúcommunist‚Äù way, having many people working all their life for it, in exchange for health, primary education for their children and a house in Gratuitous Bailment, all for free, in addition to an absolutely high well-being in relation to the average of the rest of the country, nevertheless totally isolated from any external stimulus.What motivated me here was the visible impact of the social, environmental and urban alteration by topographic means, as part of a developing post-industrial society. As a result, I have been there 6 times and four exhibitions have been made in Santiago, Calama and Valpara√≠so, showing part of this work and investigation.Minerals, as raw materials, having the condition of being undifferentiated ‚Äúevernew‚Äù products of massive consumption, are both local and global cultural commodities, simultaneously. What I could analyze from this work is how minerals‚Äîin this case, copper‚Äîaffect not only a local environment and society, but also the global economy. How a national benefit depends also on global rates determined by an ideology of newness that establishes a network of connectivity between those industrialized countries‚Äîand therefore, landscapes‚ÄîSince July 2007 I have moved to Berlin, stablishing a distance from my past work, but at the same time, finding a new inspiring energy with the social phenomenon that Germany is undergoing, due to its unique political history. After working in a country affected entirely by the copper industry, I have continued my investigation on mineral impacts, but now focusing on Coal, not only from its historic value in Germany as a natural resource and heat provider, but also as a material to address a sense of landscape, from Macro to Micro; where it comes from (the Coal mining industry), and how it goes as an energy provider.From the perspective of another culture and experience in post-industrial impacts, I want to explore a sense of landscape, contrasting very large scopes with the essence of what is beneath this land, reading it like a ‚Äúscientific document‚Äù, in order to become completely generic metaphors: a landscape that can be nowhere and everywhere at the same time.Michelle Letelier, July 2008",3/21/04 0:00,http://www.nowhere.cl/,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,Inventory notes: 2011-08-28 (ellen) Site taken over by artist portfolio.

A hand written, unbroken line of text and data about recent genetic developments threads through the images, and leads the viewer to the gallery garden, where an 11 foot sculpture completes the experience.  ‚ÄúOMNI SERIES‚Äù refers to ‚ÄúOmphalus,‚Äù another word for navel and in Greek mythology, a totem regarded as the center of the earth. ‚ÄúThe umbilical cord was once the core of our existence/nourishment and our most profound human bond,‚Äù says Twomey. ‚ÄúIt also contains the stem cells that help shape our destiny with their unique genetic code.‚Äù  At the opening, a live camera collected new image samples of people/navels to enrich the exhibition source.

It includes references to the sea and the navigators of the oceans, of which it has been said ""they were the astronauts of their age.""Words arrive on the screen from where you are, plotting position and order for the words from its internal ""map"" reading back through the server addresses of other visitors to the orbital engine. A weaving together of languages (poetic and programming).The orbital engine is a generative piece, running on two databases; the text of the poem itself and a list of logged IP addresses of visitors to the engine. It is programmed using Flash 4 and Perl. Counting back through the IP address list, the engine plots the next word of the poem in a three dimensional plane, using the first three numbers of the IP address as its x, y and z co-ordinates. The fourth number in the IP address determines the next word from the poem to be displayed.In its early stages, under the working title 'clusters,' the engine was designed to produce a visible map of activity on the site, with each request appearing as a single pixel lit on the screen; plotting successive HTTP requests from Class A, B and C IP addresses in the three dimensional plane. Requests from seperate machines on the same network would result in clusters in a two dimensional plane (Class A), a line (Class B) or on a point (Class C).Inspired by Mac Dunlop's poem 'orbital', The engine was re-written to use the words of the poem rather than pixels to show activity on the page. This format also resulted in the creation of a generic engine which can use the words of any poem as the source of the generative work; see alsothe numbers and the nameshttp://www.herenorthere.org/11.09.01/echelonhttp://www.herenorthere.org/!/technical requirements:flash plugin (v4+)",5/30/01 0:00,http://www.herenorthere.org/orbital,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: engine, poetryDate created: 2001-05-30",5/30/01 0:00,,,"allegory, Animation, Collaborative, Conceptual, Flash, information map, interface, Internet, language, Mac Dunlop, machine, Neil Jenkins, network, Perl, software, space, Text, www.herenorthere.org"40048,Oribotics [laboratory],,,Matt Gardiner,"Oribotics [laboratory] continues Matt Gardiner's exploration of robotic origami, which focuses on the natural beauty found in the mechanical motion of folded forms.

At present the research is engaged with works that have lifelike qualities, plants and in particular flowers.The 2005 generation of oribotic flowers respond to changing light levels, and can be networked with light from data projectors to reflect the status of weather from cities around the world. Users interact with the work by sending simple text commands as SMS messages using their mobile phone. As commands flow into the oribots ecosystem, the network makes lighting and soundscape shifts in relation to the new command and the live weather data.The motion of the oribot blossoming is swift, uncanny, beautiful, durable, and suggestive of the nature of pure oribotics to come.",11/22/05 0:00,http://www.oribotics.net,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"Comments from user: Oribotics is a hybrid field Art and Science that fuses Robotics and the ancient Art of Origami.

OVERSATURATION is common in most global processes as the fluxes: material and linguistic evolve real time in shape and magnitude. these fluxes, acting onto limited spaces (of conscience, the earth's surface, bandwidth, etc), add pressure on their host surfaces, and that pressure is defined by each process itself. as organisms keep multiplying and processes evolving in complexity, the available space becomes more limited and eventually tends to disappear. this game is about keeping your personal space clear, and as in life it's theoretically an infinite process.PLAYING: downlad and install. on the menu, use spacebar to enter the options desired, or esc to go back. for playing: use all four arrows on your keyboard to move through the gamespace. the OBJECTIVE of the game is to keep the continuously growing systems from oversaturating your space by passing through, and thereby annihilating them. the longer the structures remain untouched, the more they'll grow in thickness and strength, and the older the segments become, the more difficult they are to pass, or even impossible.INTERFACE: two systems evolving real time within different patterns: first, a matrix: that's your gamespace, it expands, and you cannot get past it, or else you'll bounce back. second: a set of five random spatial saturating patterns which you'll have to destroy: when a certain percentage of the cube is occupied by those patterns, you will suffocate, even if there's still available space. atop the three dimensional live action, there's couple two-dimensional maps, each one providing a real time, planar representation of the state of the whole system, the one on the left shows the top view, while the one on the right is the side view, so you can have an idea on how the space is being saturated and where the available space is.QUICK MODDING: open the game contents and locate the config.lua and/or artpack.lua on: oversaturation/resources/scripts. both files can be edited using a simple text editor. the files itself contain a small explanation that's pretty clear, or download the source code.TECHNICAL: this is an openGL based, 3D videogame, exploring oversaturation through gameplay, visual, audio experience, and hardware load. this game is based on the source code of the meticulosly wrttten: GL_Tron , by andreas umbach, for further development, we have used: c, c++, lua scripting language and the following libraries and frameworks: openGL, SDL, SDL Sound, SDL net, Lua, Nebu. this is an opensource project, released under the GNU general public license.This work has been produced with Mexico City in mind.",1/1/05 0:00,http://ungravity.org/oversaturation,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/31964/oversaturation.dmg,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: private space, open GL, self generative structures, repetitive interaction, oversaturation, suffocationDate created: 2005-01-01",1/1/05 0:00,,,"3D, Abstract, allegory, audio, Collaborative, Conceptual, death, download, eric werkhoven, gabriel acevedo, game, Generative, immersion, interact, luis hernandez, Mexico City, oversaturation, software, space, ungravity.org, Virtual, Virtual reality, Visual"2219,p r o x i m a t e . o r g,Patrick,Herron,Patrick Herron,"Hi there. in the end will be the flesh and the flesh will be made wordPlease take a stroll down the gallery path of p r o x i m a t e .o r g. The site is home to the exploration of the effects, possibilities, and limitations of the internet on textual and graphical communication.  It explores the limitations of the internet as a means for human relations, the loss of the gestic in text and image & parodic attempts to recover it, and the distance of human relations on the internet.WHAT THE NAME The site is named 'proximate' as a nod to the concept of proxemics in human communication. Proximate communications, specifically oral communications, contain extralinguistic information, e.g., body language & context, that remote communications such as recordings or textual communications do not have, cannot have. The hope of the internet as some sort of transcendent medium deserves serious skepticism when placed in such a light. Such a light also gives us opportunity for discovering the positive. There's always the tension, the conflict.The name ""proximate"" is also a pun on intimacy on the internet, as in a proxy mate. We all know sex sells, especially on the internet. The internet seems to be used as a proxy for human contact and proximal communication, which gives me pause. Such an intuition adds to what I sense as a sort of growing desperation for real, physical human contact, particularly in America, with everyone working on him- or herself, never time for affection, only time for status, career, a new car. Such use of energy may be at odds with a more positive force in life. The world has some strange dynamic property to it; there's something beyond our knowledge, yet within, around; perhaps such a thing helps explain the necessity for contact. The internet is often used as a substitute for that contact, but it can't do that well. There is NO substitute. The ""i"" that the pun pivots on is relevant to a constant concern throughout the site regarding identity. ""I""? Y? WHY THE SITE I have authored this site as a byproduct of discussions I have shared about the internet, interface design and human gesture, the pretensions of proximity in web pages and the actual distances constructed by them, and some resulting poetry. Most of the discussions were this past summer and autumn through subsubpoetics (an e-mail list started by Jordan Davis) with Alan Sondheim and two close friends, one a writer, the other a designer. (Some material from these dialogues can be found at another web site: http://gesture.org/text.html.) I am interested precisely in the type of relationships that web pages build between people. I have observed that this internet aesthetic, this relater, is a duplicitous one (getting back to the original definition of art?) -- that the writing styles typical of e-talk and the ""personalization"" of web pages add up to make a user feel close, proximate, A SOMEBODY, while all along the relationship is constructed at an incalculably great distance. Such a great distance, that it allows the person or persons constructing the content, who is trying to get your attention or most likely your money, to completely disregard those at the receiving end of the communication. Like the power of a bomb; you can destroy people and not even have to suffer through witnessing it. This web site appears in lieu of a book. Besides, such material would make little or no sense only in print. Of course, publishing the work on the internet pretty much guaranteed the publication. Makes it easier to work from outside the system as well. p r o x i m a t e tries to imitate this confrontational, faux-personal aspect of the internet in ludicrous ways, in some poems (""Come Closer!,"" ""Simon Says,"" etc.) . Other poems engage a more sincere aspect, such as the relation between nature and the binary of computing, or my creeping suspicion that web pages are multiplying in the fashion of A.M. country stations, albeit at a greater rate, thus undermining this ""personalized"" bright future the internet is supposed to provide. All web pages seem the same after a while. I am primarily interested here in confrontation and the language unit of the sentence and the chord structures of poems (as I mis/read Ashbery), as opposed to the syllable, the notes of poems. I have a strong interest in interface design, as interfaces on the internet (or in all technologies, even writing?) are the starting points for my discussion, as interfaces are the most immediate contact we have with others, though letters and graphics and hypertext links. HOW THE SITE p r o x i m a t e is linear, as I wanted the site to feel less like a ""Choose your own Adventure"" book and more like a neglected side hallway in an old art gallery space. The site contains several poems, including 2 kinetic poems, a few RealAudio recordings of readings with some background processing in some cases, some original graphics, and some groundwork for new interfaces (which are now static). Perhaps the structure is a gesture of my sincerity, as the face of much of the material is one of sarcasm and duplicity (multiplicity?). I felt I could point out internet-style duplicity by exaggerating it. Of course, without the internet, this work would be meaningless. The internet has afforded me the opportunity to publish in such a fashion. As much as I criticize the Internet, I cannot imagine a time or place in the past where a maturing writer could develop in a fashion that is at once independent and public. Proximal and distal. For this I am not only fortunate but grateful. With this site I have something at stake, both as a poet and as a professional web designer & developer. The job pays my bills, the poetry inflates my lungs, but I wanted something devoid of such a feeble opposition, a place where the two could meet. The result is p r o x i m a t e . o r g .  Stroll through this site, a home to the exploration of the effects, possibilities, and limitations of the Internet on textual and graphical communication.

Sturm,"Pacific Pulse is sculpted from sonifications of spectral data from fourteen buoys that extend along the entire Pacific coast of the United States. The data was collected during November and December of 2001, which were particularly active months: one swell removed 50,000 cubic yards of sand in one night from a single beach. The fourteen datasets were sonified using several spectral transpositions and window shapes and sizes. A total of 266 minutes of sound was synthesized, of which about 40 minutes was used in the piece.Sonifications of the entire coast using different parameters are presented in four sections. In one section these are arranged in the circle of speakers according to latitude to hear the movement of wave trains from north to south as circular panning. The final section is composed from all fourteen buoys sonified with three different transpositions, creating a particularly full sound. Gestures and ornaments accompany the sections, linked by short transitions, or interludes. In one section gestures of low rumbling waves are superimposed on flowing, high transpositions. The difference between the frequency spaces is like the liquid gap between the surface and deep ocean floor. Pacific Pulse attempts to craft a sound-space as massive as the ocean. Curiously, the signal processing effect that gives the impression of immense space---reverberation---was almost unnecessary; the fourteen buoys provide natural echoes of the wave trains butting the coast. Pacific Pulse is sometimes a mimesis of waves in deep and shallow water, and at other times a reflection of the sudden chaos created by huge storm systems. It was created such that it does not rely on its origins to affect a listener. Someone who has no idea about its genesis will still have a rewarding musical experience. To realize this goal it was important to let go of the desire to keep the natural data in its natural order. In other words the sonifications are used to sculpt the piece without regard for their positions in time and space. Pacific Pulse is to be interpreted as a composition, neither as a dataset, nor as a demonstration.This piece is a culmination of my research in ocean buoy spectral sonification (http://www.composerscientist.com). Sonification, or auditory display, is a parametrical representation of data using sound, as opposed to a visual or graphic representation (http://www.icad.org). This research began in May 2001 while I was employed at the Coastal Data Information Program at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, La Jolla (http://cdip.ucsd.edu). Daily contact with the streaming data from buoys led me to wonder what it sounds like.",2/1/03 0:00,http://www.mat.ucsb.edu/~b.sturm/music/PacificPulse.htm,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/26148/www.mat.ucsb.edu/~b.sturm/music/PacificPulse.htm,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: sonification, scientific data, electroacousticDate created: 2003-02-01Date cloned: 2013-02-21",2/1/03 0:00,,,"allegory, audio, Bob L.

This rather pragmatic analysis has led me to cognify a digitality in the the work that has become a formative part of my aesthetic of some, but not all works, specifically a body of works I am calling ""Volumetric Gestures"".The visual language of these works speaks in terms of the bitmap and the vector as well as form, line, gesture, and action; the aesthetic could be called ""digitalist"" perhaps, since ""digital"" simply describes a binary transcription.After completing a series of images working with 3D wireframe chalice forms, I was introduced by art historian Andrew Hershberger to the wireframe goblets of Paolo Ucello, hand-drawn in pencil with machinelike precision by the artist in 1450. This closed a circle for me, and made me realize the circularity and connectedness of time and thought.In the incorporation of technology-based art media in my studio practice, I feel there is a new modernism which I seek; one which escapes the postmodern loop and lives in the moment, a place beyond context. Data has been aestheticised, and aesthetics have been coded; we as artists are in a position of responsibility to leave some artifacts behind.

There wasn't, to the author, a more real way to represent spatiality: pictorical representation was substituted then by real space.As tension on Fontana's canvas favored cutting through it and showing ""over"" the canvas the ""behind the picture"", Manuel's grace to generate code and a constant quest for conceptual foundations made him able to generate this ""incision"" on the browser window, which is often the digital canvas.""Perforation"", through its relation with Fontana's oeuvre, can also be read as a vindication of net.art as a new mean for artistic expression.

It is time-dependent, almost non-repeating, cannot be printed, and cannot be viewed in its entirety. The pattern is not the result of coding (besides straight-forward HTML). Designs based upon this principle are easily developed by anyone who can create an animated GIF.The pattern shown here will perform 2.68 x 10^16 cycles before it repeats. Assuming one second per cycle, then you will need to view it for 850,223,044 years in order to see it repeat the initial state. This is due to the relative time synchronization of the sequence of the frames in each animated GIF file.This quilt requires one HTM file and 10 GIF files; a total of 11 files (only 55,582 bytes). The animated GIFs are arranged in a patchwork pattern using an HTML table. While not esthetically ground-breaking (future versions are certain to be more eye-pleasing), the concept of creating a non-code based, almost-perpetual, non-repeating pattern is significant.From Simple To Complex - There is no sophisticated coding weaving this quilt. It is actually woven very simply with ten unique animated GIF files, each with a different number of frames based on a series of primes. Therefore, to calculate the number of cycles before it repeats you need to multiply all these numbers together: 29 x 31 x 37 x 41 x 43 x 47 x 51 x 53 x 59 x 61 = 2.68 x 10^16Interesting layered effects are easily created by using simple HTML formatting options. For example, animated GIFs may be configured as the page background, in a table background, in a cell background and inserted in the cell itself. This represents at least four levels of layering. In addition, tables can be inserted within tables.",1/3/05 0:00,http://home.comcast.net/~tgreenbaum/anim_tex/quilt.htm,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/30306/quilt.htm,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: GIF patchwork quilt perpetual ephemeral web graphic non-repeating synchronization frames sequence non-code prime number cycles patternComments from user: A representation of ephemeral web art that is time dependent, almost non-repeating, cannot be printed, and cannot be viewed in its entirety.

The work comes equipped with a ‚Äúhyper:liner:notes‚Äù that randomly generates bits of narrative information tracing the social interaction of a network of artists, utopian dot.comers, DJs, and anti-copyright enthusiasts looking for the next cultural revolution. The PHON:E:ME project was commissioned by the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and the Perth Institute of Contemporary Art in Western Australia, with additional funding from the Australia Council for the Arts and the Jerome Foundation.Critical theorist Steve Shaviro, in his catalogue essay for the PHON:E:ME web site at the Walker Art Center, said ‚ÄúMark Amerika works at the critical point where new sensory ratios are starting to emerge. Most obviously, his piece plays with the intersection between the ear and the eye, between what we hear and what we see. More subtly, it also explores a disjunction within the eye itself:  between what we can read and what we can only look at.‚ÄùWhereas GRAMMATRON experiments with the hypertextuality of the Internet as an interconnected global computer network, PHON:E:ME much more consciously investigates the way auditory media pervades our daily lives and how this in turn effects the way we experience what have become routine cultural practices such as reading, writing, listening to music, and surfing the Internet. With a multitude of viable media formats and cultural objects fighting for our attention, questions of choice and designing our own interactive experiences come to the fore. By experimenting with both the design interface as well as the artistic content constructed especially for the PHON:E:ME web site, Amerika is attempting to find ways to express the impact of this audio-visual ‚Äúnoise‚Äù while inviting the participant -  the artistic ‚Äúco-conspirator‚Äù -  to create their own alternative version of the work based off of the parameters the artist put in place.The work has been exhibited in many venues including Videobrasil in Sao Paolo, the Zeppelin Sound Festival in Barcelona, and the Walker Art Center‚Äôs ‚ÄúArt Entertainment Network‚Äù show as part of the traveling ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Entertain‚Äù exhibition.

Using an algorithm that prioritizes both a consistency of form and a variation of content, it generates a pulse of the world. The algorithm uses the popular google-api to search in real-time for photos of various camera types: sony, canon, kodak, casio, nokia cell phones, etc. While a few other artworks and websites use similar search engine technologies and algorithms to locate random images, Photo Noise is unique for its non-interactive simplicity and passivity. Referring back to traditional experiences of media and art viewing (television, radio, gallery walls and floors) it attempts to bridge the gap between passive experience and a cumbersome network containing billions of pages and images. Typical access to this information requires one to do various activities such as to navigate, search, find, choose, look, think, possibly go back, close a window, click again, search, change options, type again, click, choose, close, click, search, open, and view and click. It has even been theorized that the amount of mental effort to locate and filter such information, sometimes outweighs the benefits of the findings. Photo Noise invites you to sit back and relax as the photographs made by the people in your world come and go.More about the software used in Photo Noise...as it might appear to be nothing more than a simple one-page internet script. It favors the traditional design principle of encapsulation, to ensure a lazy, almost boring experience for users at any level. This may differ from many other current forms of software art, where the code or the engine are visually or conceptually very present in the work. But here, the software is designed so that it looks like there is no software. In actuality, this program is responsible for many things such as: finding 'good' numbers from the random.org api; uptime and reliability; balancing camera default filename schemes with google search result probabilities; carefully managing the usage of limited and precious google api queries; hacking the bitter reality that the google-api doesn't even allow for the 'image search' function; dealing with slow result servers; useless thumbnails; filtering and maintaining a fifo queue of findings; client navigation of queue; caching; image scaling; and so forth. This is not to say the software and algorithms are perfected or even terribly complex, but they do indeed exist! To encapsulate the software within a minimal interface, for me, is somewhat of a non-materialistic approach to the software medium.

[synopsis]Ping Melody is a music-net-performance. Temporary and unique state of all actions of Internet users has an influence on form of music composition. Musician (instrumentalist or singer) is playing on acoustic instrument/singing and sounds coming from instrument/voice are shared in packets of data information (granulated), then transmitted to selected Internet location (as ""ping"" unix command).The order of packet‚Äôs return, packet‚Äôs delays, transmission errors alerts are incorporated, and the information coming from these actions is controlling in the real time the transformation of played sound. Performance will be accompanying by visualisation, showing tracks of data and information of errors, etc. Dedicated software is a kind of sampler (granular synthesizer) and pitch tracker, which is using Internet to transform and create sound construction. Musician is improvising, treating software, which is transforming sound coming from his instrument, as a partner - a kind of second musician.Most of net artists are using some specific possibilities of Internet: they are working with WWW, streaming, etc. In Ping Melody I treat Internet not so much as a tool which functions in given way, but as a space, that can be observed. I am specially interested in some sub-possibilities of Internet, that are growing out of simultaneous activity of huge count of its users - mental space, although objectivated: map od data transfer as a dynamic sum of actions taken by net users.In various philosophical and theological schools or traditions there is an idea which describes universe as a composition of ideal component (that is not the subject to inspection) and material component (on the observation we can draw the conclusions of first one). This kind of probe has got a long tradition in the history of philosophy. In Ping Melody - sending sampled sound in net and receiving signal coming back from some server - I can conclude about processing from the audible differences between source and resulted signal.In performance I use single instrumentalist and sound of acoustic instrument in opposition to collective character of scanned dataspace. Masterly acoustic instrument play in connected on one hand with technical perfection, and on the other - with ability of giving an individual tone to uttered sound. In case of musicians dealing with improvisation, it is also connected with ability to react on occurring changes and to compose them in own sound form.This ability is particularly important in Ping Melody: music improvisation is created here in relation to unique, temporary entirety of world‚Äôs information exchange, that‚Äôs why only aware catching its characteristic points by musician (or rather characteristic of processes at a given moment) makes possible creation of sound form, consisted of some more than only mechanic reproduction of caused by net distortions, reflecting on source sound material.homepage: http://ping.wrocenter.plPing Melody is curated and supported by WRO Center for Media Art [http://wrocenter.pl].",5/1/03 0:00,http://paweljanicki.jp/pingmelody_main_en.html,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,Date created: 2003-05-01,5/1/03 0:00,,,"Event, HTML, Internet, live, Pawel Janicki, performance, PING MELODY, software, wrocenter.pl/projects/ping/index.html"46716,PIRATE,ANnikA,LARSSON,ANnikA LARSSON,"PIRATE, 2006/07, 8.25 min loop, colour, sound, exhibition format DVD and mpeg4 (cc) 2006/07 ANNIKA LARSSONFilmed, edited and produced by Annika Larsson.

A person sits at the console and plays a video game, in which the goals are to stay alive and explore a simulation of Playas, New Mexico, USA. The presence of others within the installation space transforms the game image into a mirage, which is projected into the exhibition environment. Virtual game characters include innocents, terrorists, and Department of Homeland InSecurity (DHI) agents. Playas was a company railroad town, established in the early 1900s.  It was abandoned and then reconstructed as a suburban mining town in the seventies. Abandoned again in 1999, Playas was purchased in 2004 as the site of a training facility for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. As the player explores each home in the Playas construct, historical photographs from the site are displayed. Environmental background information and imagined family scenarios are available on demand. Objects left behind in the abandoned homes trigger video imagery that questions our responsibilities and place in the world. Meanwhile, as other human participants enter the installation zone, a video tracking system monitors them and spawns a new virtual character for each.

It directly draws from and incorporates many of the long-established themes of mail art including, like that of the earliest works, and to a lesser degree contemporary works of Internet art, the deliberate positioning of art outside of the rigid art/museum/gallery system.Those within this system, however, who will be/were unknowingly targeted by the artist to receive the postcard, are the ones who are, or will be, providing the content of the project, that of access (exclusivity), hierarchy (importance) and commercialization of art.  Out of the 500 to whom the postcard is addressed, who will actually receive it, who will choose to reply and in what fashion?  An analysis will follow.The project does find its home within, and is certainly an exploitation of, the commercial space(s) of the internet and direct mail advertisement.  The postcard is glossy, obviously professional printed and will undoubtedly arrive with several unsolicited offers for credit or other forms of ""junk mail.""  The webpage is clean, inspired by the design of Google, and with the utilization of bookmarks or tabs, could simply be one click away from sites such as Ebay or Amazon.Lastly, while the public exhibition of mail art has occurred numerous times over its comparably brief history, the postcard project deliberately takes that which is by nature private, mail and email correspondence, a physical address, and makes it intimately available to a mass public, a community of individual users.",10/1/06 0:00,http://www.noprogram.org/postcard/postcard2.htm,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"Date created: 2006-10Date created: 2006-10-01",10/1/06 0:00,,,"access, Actions, art world, Artistic collaboration, commercialization, community, Conceptual, Conceptual art, Database, Documentary, email, Event, HTML, identity, Information visualization, interact, Interactive art, Internet, marginality, network, noprogram.org, Participatory, performance, postmodern, privacy, public space, Social classes, social space, Technology"3490,POSTCARD.project::,d,planet,dplanet::,"""Everywhere in the minutiae of our material culture, we encounter reminders of the availability of authentic experiences at others times and in other places....

It is also an attempt to foster community and collaboration around dplanet:: by creating a POSTCARD_network and a feedback loop (POSTCARDS are displayed on dplanet and altsense so many of the POSTCARDS include previous POSTCARDS which have been displayed). This project was inspired by a conversation I had with Marcus Neustetter, a Johannesburg-based artist. We discussed the value of the 'art object' in digital culture and the potential manifestations of digital art in the physical world. [Inspiration was also derived from etoy's share concept which ""...is a radical transformation of art ownership in the digital age. The rigidly limited number of etoy.SHARE-UNITS available on the art market replaces the idea of the (physical) original art masterpiece.""] We also discussed the desire to avoid the dplanet:: community sharing common experiences in collective isolation. Using postcards as the medium of delivery seemed perfect. ""Postcards allow people to keep in touch without having to actually say anything. A notable thing about postcards is how trite the messages often are: ""The weather is great. Wish you were here."" A letter like that would be ludicrous, even rude. Yet the main point of a postcard is its subtext: I'm thinking of you, just checking in, making the rounds remotely. The picture on the card takes the place of the message. It lets the sender express a bit of his or her taste like sending a little gift."" - Inhabiting the Virtual City, Judith S. Donath. This project also deals with the environment in which digital art or design is viewed. Curators and gallery owners go to great lengths to ensure a controlled setting for viewing traditional art. As web-based screen designers we have no say in the way our work is viewed, we have no control over the physical location, monitor settings, light conditions and so on. Part of the excitement of web-based design is the notion that thousands of people in different geographical locations can be viewing the same thing at the same time in their own unique environments.

My primary focus at this time is the development of a project with the general title ""Tumbleweed"" that is organized to be accessed through a foreground platform, an index and guide called <i> i o l a </i> (and yes the html tags for italics are part of the title) but will have any number of methods of access in the future. The URL is:""http://artnetweb.com/iola""The entire project is an evolving investigation into the possibilities of multi-dimensional on-line environments and will be one model for what many think of as a ""virtual museum."" I use this term with hesitation but acknowledge that it has become common to think of an online representation as something virtual, meaning unreal, and is a result of thinking in terms of multimedia CD-ROM and other forms of digital delivery that have become current but are not necessarily applicable to a networked environment like the Internet.My definition of virtual would be closer to ""universal,"" meaning a museum of the possible. In the end ""unreal"" and ""universal"" may mean the same thing in that the term ""universe"" is a metaphor for what we can't wholly comprehend, a lie we tell ourselves to avoid thinking the unthinkable. So a better term would be potential and that's why I subtitle this project ""a potential museum,"" a ""house of the muses"" that is based not on a collection education, connoiseurship or any other aspect of our current institutions but on what the muses (the daughters of memory) promise -- potentiality.As for the use of ""tumbleweed"" the only reason for using it I can give now is that a tumbleweed only exists in motion, when still it's a dead bush.

Some believed in a personal guardian spirit who must be treated with respect and kept private, and who therefore must remain unphotographed. The difference between private life and public life was very clear for them. For us, things are not so well defined.Project|Capture deals in this way with the disappearing realm of the private in modern life. When original source material discovered on the internet is translated to another medium, a process called ""transference"" occurs. With each transference, the orginal representation of an individual is inherently changed.  A piece of the self is taken, recontextualized, repurposed, transformed.  In a hundred years, the photos you posted on the web may be all that is left of you. The medium is not only the message, the medium is you.In Project|Capture each painting is named for an IP address which in turn sends the viewer back to the internet and towards the original source for the artwork, which may or may not be easily found.  In this way, the traditional medium of oil painting is extended both backwards and forwards into the modern medium of the internet.The paintings in Project|Capture are not portraits, they are transferences with all that the word implies: technology, duplication, reinterpretation, transcendence, the extraction of a part of the essence of what it is to be a human being.",5/26/06 0:00,http://sonjaschenk.com/english/EGLindex-main.html,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"Date created: 2007-02-14Date created: 2006-05-26",5/26/06 0:00,,,"body, Conceptual, contextual, desire, digital, disappearance, Documentary, duplication, identity, interact, interface, Internet, life, marginality, memory, posthuman, privacy, public space, reinterpretation, social space, surveillance, transcendence, transference, transformation, Visual"3152,project|dante,Dariusz,Nowak-Nova,Dariusz Nowak-Nova,"I am interested in myth, mythology, archetypes, reality and the relationes, which take place among them.

It is completely autonomous and needs very little assistance and maintenance.RAP creates it's own paintings based on an artificial intelligence algorithm, it decides when the work is ready and signs it in the right bottom corner with its distinctive signature.RAP is very creative and never repeats a painting.RAP has a set of sensors to avoid obstacles, to perceive the presence of visitors near the case, to check the paper, and most important to detect color. A total of 9 RGB color sensors, located under the robot body and disposed in a 3 x 3 grid, permanently scans an area of approximately 3 cm2.RAP will be operating under a Random Mode until a certain amount of color (threshold) is detected. In this mode the robot makes a kind of sketch, randomly drawing a series of lines. The shape, size, direction and color of these lines are also drawn in a randomly way. In this sense it never produces the same lines or the same combination of lines.In the Random Mode in order to generate a truly random number for the seed, RAP gets it from its relative direction measured by an onboard compass.When the color detected exceeds the threshold, RAP changes to a Reactive Mode. It will be drawing on this mode until it finishes the painting, never getting back to the previous mode of operation.Under the Reactive Mode RAP only draws in those parts of the drawing where the color exceeds the given threshold. Therefore it tends to generate color clusters on some areas.Making use of its color sensor grid RAP decides when the work is ready. That happens when a certain pattern is detected with all of the 9 sensors. It then goes to the corner and signs with its own name.After signing, the robot moves to the center of the paper, starts flashing its lights and sends a wireless signal to the paper machine. This machine, installed on the bottom part of the box case, advances the paper roll, feeding the table with a fresh sheet for a new drawing.  RAP is a new generation of painting robots designed for Museum or long exhibition displays. It is completely autonomous and need very little assistance and maintenance.RAP creates it's own paintings based on an artificial intelligence algorithm, it decides when the work is ready and signs in the right bottom corner with its distinctive signature.The algorithm combines initial randomness, positive feedback and a positive/negative increment of 'color as pheromone' mechanism based on a grid of nine RGB sensors.Also the 'sense of rightness' - to determine when the painting is ready - is achieved not by any linear method, time or sum, but through a kind of pattern recognition system.",1/20/06 0:00,http://www.leonelmoura.com/rap.html,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"Date created: 2006-01-20Date created: 2006-01-20",1/20/06 0:00,,,"Abstract, American Museum of Natural History, Anti-art, art world, ARTificial ART, artificial life, Generative, machine, Man and Robots, New York, performance, posthuman, robot, Robotic Action Painter"24926,rassur,Annie,Abrahams,annie abrahams,"rassur' 'Being human' is about communication with the other via the net.

The media has assumed the role of public relations officer simply reflecting and reiterating our national foreign policy instead of fostering discourse. Any hint of criticism is nearly considered sedition. This proposal is meant to illustrate a process of redefining and a potential shifting of ""traditional"" avenues of information. We propose to use readily available technology to re-channel the direction of information from mega-corporate centralized mediated information capitols to a decentralized community-based series of networks. Our goals are to process and reprocess information as individuals that are members of separate communities and yet bound by technology, to democratize and amplify individual voices cross-culturally and globally. We have invited various artists to open their homes, studios, and/or institutions to the communities to which they respectively (and respectfully) belong, allowing members of the community access to technology. They will be assisted in articulating their own story through the digital media, while we at the Boston point of the network will be using both the digital and traditional printmaking process to foster our end of the dialogue. During a 24-hour period between April 2 and April 5, 2003, an international network will be created for the electronic exchange of text and imagery. Through the use of email, fax or other communicative devices, this free transmission and reception of information will be put in motion by groups or individuals operating as hubs located around the planet. One such station will be in place in Boston at the 2003 Southern Graphics Council Conference. There we will receive, manipulate, combine, process and reproduce through traditional print media any incoming data. These serigraphs, monoprints, linocuts, transfers etc. will be digitized and transmitted back through the network for further manipulations and exchanges among hub members and their communities. In order to address the issues of entitlement, empowerment, privilege and the elitism of our tradition, all hub participants are asked to enlist members of their local community to participate in this exchange. Most welcome is the inclusion of those silenced or marginalized by lack of access to technology, individuals not considered to be artists (or to be ""creative"") by others or themselves, and those who may not have realized their ability to effect cultural change or augmentation. In collaboration with GC&SU faculty and students, the Boston hub will involve random conference attendees in the development and creation of the hand-pulled prints, of which they may then take physical ownership. Through this project we deny geopolitical divisions and promote a decentrilized and democratic experience in which leadership and responsibility rest with each participant, all freely sharing in the control, outcome and ownership of the media.

The very realistic appearance of virtual worlds will make users strongly emotional bound to them, so it will become the parallel society and have a very strong influence on the ""real life"". That's why it is very important for us artists to help forming new, positive ethics for virtual worlds. Ethics, which are based on openes, freedom and human rights, instead  on the paradigm ""the right for the profit"".The aim of virtual reality should be to make dreams come true for everyone, not again only to those, who can buy it. Selling an virtual Island, which is nothing else but few kilobytes of data, for 1000 US$ + 120 US$ months fee is exactly what virtual reality shouldn't be. And it don't need to be, because there are tools, standards and technical possibilities to build  virtual worlds without limitations, where one makes his Island, state or planet on his own server or webpage and share it with others for free. We don't need virtual shopping centres, we need virtual reality to spread our fantasy and associate with people from around the world. To make people closer to each other, not to make differences between rich and pure, developed and undeveloped, even bigger. But one corporation, Linden Labs has convinced people, that the new 3-dimensional web is their own online multiplayer game Second life, which is stricktly draft on commercial values.Linden Labs, owner of Second life has the best PR department on the planet. They have suckered the press and marketing communities like no one else I have ever seen. That's why people think, Second life is a new 3D web, but in fact Its a private environment, the equivalent of one office building in a city. It keeps trying to protray itself as open and opensource like but the truth is there is one door. A place like second life is too experimental and seemingly open, but essentially you are operating under THEIR umbrella. If you create a 3D world and put it up on your own server space, then you are INDEPENDENT. The web3D needs to focus on bringing 3D directly to the webserver, not to be pushed on individual webpages and by companies who are focusing their virtual worlds efforts to very specific applications.Second Life bought about a lot of hype and at this point, I think its negative publicity. To the outside, Second Life looks like a place full of freaks, REAL freaks, but in fact the only application second life has perfected is to mirror the worst social vibe of the real world, instead of trying to create an atmosphere which extracts the best dreams from the real world. That's why I built this platform, called Real 3D friend: because friend is not the one, who wants to sell you something. It is a platform, which uses open tools and standards,  the real 3D web, not just one web page, owned by some corporation, build with one single purpose: to make money.In contrary to Second life and other closed worlds, which are entry points to one world on one server, is Real 3D friend entry point into the real 3D web, an open web of millions of free virtual worlds and places, where people share virtual ""things"" instead trying to sell them. It is a world for human relations instead for business relations.",5/13/08 0:00,http://www.s-p-i-l-l-e-r.com/3D/,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,,5/13/08 0:00,,,"3dweb, a world of my own, active worlds, Artistic collaboration, entropia universe, Information visualization, interactive 3d online game, Interactive art, Internet, kaneva, moove, scenecaster, Second Life, Technology, there, Virtual reality, VRML, world of craft"47989,RealityCPU,Tabor,Robak,Tabor Robak,"Our computers and simulated worlds are  simulacra of reality. They provide a contrast to the real world that, when compared, reveal the value in the authenticity of reality and the qualities that make us human. However, the strict rules of reality and the limitations of the brain provide the same contrast, making the flexible rules of video games and the power of a computer so enjoyable. RealityCPU.com explores a few similar juxtapositions: that between humans and technology, the organic and the manmade, the real world and virtual worlds, human emotions and computer stoicism, and life and its portrayal in video games. A harmony and a friction can be currently found between the these in our modern existence. This condition is explored through a ongoing series of vignettes that relate life to technology using the visual and verbal language of computers, technology, and video games, combined with a certain raw quality that provides them a sense of the organic. They are refereed to as Levels, a term adopted from video games that is descriptive of function and aesthetics of the vignettes.A level of a video game presents an artistic interpretation of the real world. The content of the vignettes is the matter of the real world seen through a digital lens. A level is something that is experienced and played through, taking time to reveal its self. This is similar to the way the vignettes are experienced, requireing the viewer to take some time to fully experience the image due to the amount of animation and visual stimulation contained within each vignette. The looping animated gifs are similar to the qualities of nature because their motion is both ambient and persistent, and they reveal more detail the closer they are examined. The graphic quality of the images is distorted, distressed, and raw; things shake and jitter in a way that speak more to the qualities of nature than digital perfection. Meanings can be derived through the interaction of these elements.In a level of a video game each players experience is unique. The limitations of the simple web technology being used to display many animations at once on RealityCPU.com insures each viewers experience with the artwork is unique. The visuals of the vignettes are displayed differently on each viewers computer due to the variety of computer configurations possible. The speed of their computer, their internet connection, the browser they are using, the size of that browser window, and the size of their monitor all affect how the graphics are displayed and ultimately how the artwork is presented. This is similar to an individuals unique perception of reality.The mythology of Reality CPU is a metaphor that communicates why it is valuable to look for meaning in the computer and technology. It attributes more meaning to the computer than we usually provide it, suggesting that a deep connection and purpose exists between humans and the computer. The authority that we exert over technology combined with the seemingly limitless ability it provides us to create is similar to the relationship between god and a universe. The Reality CPU mythology describes our existence as a simulated reality, a hypothetical computer powered simulation so advanced that it is indistinguishable from true reality. With that, it must follow that every aspect of a simulated reality is described by a computer process. True reality is infinitely complex and intangible. This analogy makes it easier appreciate reality by describing, condensing, comparing it to something familiar. RealityCPU.com is intended for anyone who has experienced technology. However, a certain audience will take the most from it, they could be called Generation Y2K. Members of this generation have been exposed to modern technology since birth, they have never known an existence not infused with technology. For them Y2K posed the most threat to their understanding of daily life, a complete change from everything they were dependent on. Technology has become fully integrated with our lives, there is no going back. Despite this, the push to maintain a connection to nature has become stronger than ever.

With stickers, tape, and paper, the League unveils their timely solution to an ecologically damaged and overpopulated planet: a DIY kit for developing outer space and settling the sea.  It's really real because fiction is realer than truth.  The League's project includes a documentary and DIY intergalactic emigration kit.The Back Story, or how a group of driven imaginary scientists became Really Real Estate‚Ñ¢ agents:In a research mission gone awry, League scientists found themselves somewhere in the Atlantic, between Bermuda, Miami, and the Lesser Antilles.  Previously considered a triangle, imaginary scientists discovered that the area of mystery is actually rectangular - its shape altered as a result of climate change brought on by global warming.  Because of the high stress and extreme conditions of their situation, infighting ensued, and the team members retreated into isolation.  Equipped for underwater exploration, Dr. Stephan Schleidan opted to stay beneath the ocean‚Äôs surface and gradually became grounded within the watery world.  The remaining researchers studied the expansion of the Bermuda Rectangle, fearful that the shape would continue to grow and possibly morph into a pentagon.  Sure enough, their studies indicate that global climate change is effectively pushing colder water from the north into the Bahamas, expanding the fourth corner at an alarming speed.  Dubbed Danger Corner, the fourth corner will soon make landfall on the eastern coast of the United States.  When this happens, planes will begin disappearing on runways.  Radio signals will stop dead.  People will be flipped in and out of the 4th dimension willy-nilly.  Tiny eddies in the fabric of space-time will coil and uncoil, causing mass hysteria, at an estimated cost of 15 US dollars annually.The solution is Really Real Estate‚Ñ¢.  The League of Imaginary Scientists offers humanity two options, Plan A and Plan B.  A majority of League specialists advocates Plan A, galactic emigration.  They consider relocation to be humanity‚Äôs best bet for avoiding the tide of destruction.  Like many other disenchanted global consumers, you may decide to enter the intergalactic market.  You can select from any number of outer spaces, each boasting a stellar view, some even with planetary naming rights.  If fearful of the unknown, you may choose to select Plan B, the venture proposed by Dr. Schleidan.  The dissenting scientist believes mass exodus is not the only answer.  Dr. Schleidan advocates embracing The Change through colonization of the sea.

At the same time it is a full functional logic exact neural network. Through its strict geometric and otherwise very filigree construction, the observer is able to track the whole processing logic from every viewpoint around the machine. This disclosure of the machines core is enforced by an uncommon distribution of its constructing elements: a nine angled architectural body forms a torus. In contrast to an ordinary alignment of a hidden logic and an outer user facing display its geometric basis is turned inside-out. The core of the machine, with all its computing elements, is shifted outwards on the surface, while the ""display"" which indicates the results of the tasks is displaced into the center of the system. Even though the tasks and their logic runs directly in front of the viewers eyes and even if one is long sinking into the interaction of the elements which is accompanied by a polyphonic but steady and reassuring buzz, it is not possible to follow the succession of the single conditions of the machine. On one hand by turning the machine inside-out its function is completly transparent, on the other hand a strict self-referentiality and ignorance to the viewer is realized. The machine turns away from the visitor and carries out its computations only for itself. Without dependending on interaction or requesting it, it goes through its own states endlessly. The results of the computations are sent inwards -into its own center- they are not intended for the viewer.

Visitors to the /reimaginings/ project uploadtheir IM conversations into a database, map the lines of the conversation tocolors and view conversations reenacted using images and text-to-speechvoice technology.By aiming for a farcical goal (improving Newton's Color spectrum by addingmore of the same colors) and using absurd methodologies (mapping colors toIM conversations), /reimaginings/ provokes the visitor to question theveracity of data-mapping, hyperlinking and scientific rhetoric by beingconstantly perched at the edge of language, graphic and technologicalseduction and an uneasy sense that the project is incomprehensibly complexand ridiculous.",2/15/04 0:00,http://www.turbulence.org/Works/reimaginings/,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: research, mapping, visualizationDate created: 2004-02-15",2/15/04 0:00,,,"Animation, audio, Collaborative, Conceptual, Database, DHTML, digital, Flash, Generative, HTML, iKatun, information map, interface, Isaac Newton, Java, Javascript, Jim Bailey, Kanarinka, language, memory, MP3, network, Optiks, Participatory, performance, Pirun, software, Text, turbulence.org, Yori Sakakura"48039,Remembering Bogle Chandler,Rebecca,Young,rebecca young,"The bizarre and tragic deaths of Margaret Chandler and Gib Bogle on the banks of the Lane Cove River in Sydney, 1963, remain an elusive and intriguing Australian mystery. This website explores the theme of inconsistent and impermanent memory, allowing you to shift forward and backward through time, space and point-of-view, and so compare eyewitness accounts of the deaths. The story is represented by a dynamic montage of sound, image and text, and is controlled via a map/graph interface. As you progress through it, the project becomes less about solving the crime and more about revealing the enigma of individual experience and interpretation. It is also about how a time and place, in this case Cold War Sydney, inescapably shapes the perceptions of the people who live within it, and how people who suffer an unexplainable tragedy are often blamed for it. It is the story of an improbable murder or an implausible accident; a puzzle without a solution where objective truth becomes impossible to grasp because it does not exist.",3/10/08 0:00,http://www.rebeccayoung.org/boglechandler/movie.html,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,,3/10/08 0:00,,,"1963, Australia, bogle chandler case, fuller's bridge, gilbert bogle, Hypertext, Information visualization, Interactive art, lane cove river, margaret chandler, Montage, sydney"26312,Remix,redlizard,redlizard,redcaiman,"Remix 5.0.________________________________//Instructions//on (press ICON on LEFT CORNER){SHOW/HIDE information;read;keyboard;left hand & right hand; key;}________________________________//Collaboration//on (audio){Ben Fenton; benfenton.net;}________________________________",7/25/04 23:43,http://redcaiman.org/productos/REMIX/index.htm,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/26312/,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"Date created: 2004.08.08Date cloned: 2013-02-21",7/25/04 23:43,,,"allegory, Animation, Arg√É¬ºello Servin Tlaolli, audio, Collaborative, digital, Flash, game, Generative, HTML, interact, interface, Internet, live, Participatory, Remix 5.0, software, video, Visual"21608,Remolino de Electra,Arti,Leimbacher,Arti Leimbacher,"When the primitive painter layed down carbon and ferric oxides and swapped the canvas, the cliffs and the caves for a computer and started to draw with the mouse, the first thing he discovered was that he didn When the primitive painter layed down carbon and ferric oxides and swapped the canvas, the cliffs and the caves for a computer and started to draw with the mouse, the first thing he discovered was that he didnÔøΩt get any dirty fingers.

The long and complex narrative draws you in an explores what is truth and what is fiction in an online narrative. I encountered the phenomenon of personal pages the very first time I logged on to the Internet. It was something that had never existed before in the ordinary world. Usually you meet people first and only get to know intimate details of their lives later. Personal pages on the Internet turn the whole process around. The great majority of these pages are something like the following: you learn your new acquaintance's name, date and place of birth, where he or she works and what his or her interests are, and then you see a photo, usually taken on a holiday or at a party. The most popular are the photographs where you see your new acquaintance bathing in the sea, or stroking a dog or horse, or dancing or doing something sporty. If your new acquaintance is a woman, you will often see a modelling agency sort of photo, and if it's a man, he will want to be pictured in a gleaming automobile. Then you find out about your acquaintance's tastes in the way of books, films and music and his or her erotic idols. You'll see childhood snaps and you can click on links to the person's friends and favourite servers. You can read his or her ""motto."" In just ten minutes you know so much about him or her, but you still haven't met. And perhaps you never will. But still you already have your own opinion about the person. You can write him or her an e-mail, and perhaps get an answer. You have some kind of relationship with the person. Yes, you have an acquaintance, but the question is - who that acquaintance actually is. Is it really the person whose homepage you are reading, or is that just a person your acquaintance would like to be seen as? Or is it a person you would like to see? Isn't the picture of your acquaintance something you alter with the brush and paints of your own ideas? Your imagination? Or on the other hand, what if this apparent self-portrait of your acquaintance is the work of a cheat? Most often, both of these possibilities are true at the same time.Be that as it may, millions of personal pages are sailing through the universe of the Internet.

For more than forty years, Hanford released radioactive materials into the environment on an uninformed public while producing plutonium for the U.S. nuclear arsenal during the Cold War era. Although the majority of the releases were due to activities related to production, some were also planned and intentional.Hanford workers, their families and other downwind residents became literal guinea pigs for radiation experiments that were carried out at the facility by the former Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Defense, and civilian sub-contractors including DuPont and General Electric from 1944 to 1972.Although civilians were informed of Hanford's plutonium production activities by the end of World War II, officials in charge kept secret the growing number of radioactive releases, experiments and other environmental safety hazards resulting at the facility. During the mid-1980s, increasing public suspicion over Hanford activities forced government agencies and their civilian sub-contractors to release formally classified documents through a request under the Freedom of Information Act. With the release of these documents in 1986, the public has been able to piece together a devastating chronicle of atomic weaponry production that consequently poisoned the people it was ironically meant to protect. Thousands of area residents from towns and farms surrounding the Hanford Site and beyond have suffered an array of health problems including thyroid cancers, autoimmune diseases and reproductive disorders that they feel are the directresult of these releases and experiments.Safe as Mother's Milk examines these important events through declassified historical photographs, media and documents available online at various government archives, including the Hanford Declassified Document Retrieval System [http://www2.hanford.gov/declass/] and Human Radiation Experiments Information Management System (HREX) [http://tis.eh.doe.gov/ohre/].This project is designed as both a physical installation and Web site, originally commissioned for the Cornish College of the Arts ART | ACTIVISM 2002 Visiting Artist Series.",11/14/02 0:00,http://www.hanfordproject.com/,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: alternative documentary, environment, health, historyDate created: 2002-11-14",11/14/02 0:00,,,"archive, Atomic Energy Commission, Database, death, Documentary, education, Flash, Hanford, Hanford Nuclear Reservation, historical, HTML, installation, Javascript, Kim Stringfellow, Manhattan Project, media activism, Narrative, QuickTime, Text, US, video, Visual, War, washington, www2.hanford.gov/declass/"41064,Samples of the Ghats,Philippe,Chollet,philippe chollet,"""Samples of the Ghats"" is an interactive installation that invites its audience to re-create the ghats of Haridwar/India.

Intriguing, it acts like a magnet, an appeal to curiosity and exploration.Cruising along the panel the visitor soon discover that he can ‚Äúplay it‚Äù.

They were selected and edited because of their particular role in the social aspects of the Ghats. No comments on them, they appear and produce their effect as you interact with the installation.The result is a sensorial virtual unreality journey into the Ghats.On the narrative:Interacting with the installation, the audience determine their journey. Therefore, narrative significantly bonds to interaction.There are 2 levels of interaction. The first is individual, when each visitor launches audio and visual sequences. The second is collective, indeed you share what others have triggered, you also physically interact with them as the cruise along the panel with you.On the message:Rather than delivering a message through logic it operates on the level of emotion, thus being a sensorial gate to a city and its culture.  / Tech /Reports/Clips :Using a Nikon CoolPix 5M pixels camera for stillsUsing a Canon MV500i for videoContent :Layouts were designed in PhotoshopThe clips were edited in premiere and imported in FlashAll flash files were converted into avi format and compressed to be exploitable in Max MSP Jitter.Structure :Alluminium structureRear projection screen10 Infra-red detectors Interface-Z2 analogics Interface-Z2 Projectors2 Sound Cards Hercule 16/12fw2 Midi Sport 1x1 interface10 set of creative speakers",1/20/06 0:00,http://philippechollet.net/samples_of_the_ghats.html,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/41064/samples_of_the_ghats.html,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: virtual unreality sensorsDate created: 2006-01-20Date created: 2006-01-20Date created: 2006-01-20Date created: 2006-01-20Date created: 2006-01-20Date cloned: 2013-05-04",1/20/06 0:00,,,"BollyPlage, Documentary, immersion, installation, interact, interactive documentary, Narrative, Participatory, philippe chollet, samples of the ghats, sensitive documentary, Visual"46612,SAVE / SAFE,alexandra,reill,kanonmedia,"KANONMEDIA.COM : SAVE / SAFEMARIA MADONNA : MADONNAINTERVIEW.WITH : AUGUST.HIGHLANDG.H.HOVAGIMYAN : LANGUAGE.OF.PERCEPTIONAID : ART.AFFAIRSFORSCHUNGSKOLLEG : BIBLIOGRAFIEDOCTOR.HUGO : TELE-SYNAESTHESIASCOTT.BECKER : HUMANITYHERLANDER.ELIAS : BEYOND.SHOCKOREA : CHANDRA.TEXTSERGEJ.TETERIN : THREE.SPIRITSCD : NEUE.BESCHEIDENHEITMARC.GARRETT : NET.THERAPISTMAURO.CEOLIN : PETTO.DI.POLLOC.KONRAD : FRAGMENTEKATE.SOUTHWORTH : NOTIONS.OF.CREATIVITYTAMARA.LAI & LOIEZ.DENIEL : VIRTUAL ADDICTMAGMAFAKT : √úBERN GRABENTINI : ON.THE.ROADANNA : ANNATERO : ADAPTATIONNOEL : IRRTUMDANA : THE LONGINGX : X-FILESGOTTFRIEDE.MEIXNER : ALLES.UND.NICHTSAREILL : EIN RE-WRITINGKERRRLL: ROSTIGE.RESLRODRIGO.HERNANDEZ : MEMORIA.SUAVEHEATHER.WINTER : WILD.FEARMAYA2 : SOMETHINGDIVASTAR : ORCHIDS AT SEALEWIS LACOOK : NIRVANA.ICEDIGITSECT : RESURRECTIONY : YDIVASTAR : ORCHIDS.AT.SEA MEHMETSINAN : BEN.SENI.SEVIYORUMLACHLAN : UNMADEBEDOFCULTURE TRY1 : DOT.RETRYBRUNO : BRUNOS.REISEPPAT : FIVE.TO.NINEULY : MANMANLOLO : PITS.AND.LANDSMAORI : THE.NEXT.STEPERD : LEBENDIGKEITMINNIE : LOVE.

Inspired by the human body‚Äôs circulation system and defence mechanism in bombardier beetles, the purpose is to produce an ‚Äòaroma rainbow‚Äô scent symphony around the user, that changes with emotion.We are entering a new age of perfumery that will have a radical impact on mental health.

The aim is to produce an intimate ‚Äòscent bubble‚Äô that ‚Äòpulses‚Äô benefit chemicals in controlled ways responding to personal needs. This allows for efficient scent delivery that is targeted to specific parts of the body.

Artworks using data from the real time environment.  By Stanza,stanza,,stanza ,"The sensor networks can be moved from urban to rural setting, ( ie they are mobile) and different types of visualization can be made depending on the environment. Sensity is an open social sculpture that informs the world and creates new meaningful experiences.Sensity is also a highly technical project that gives vast amounts of information about the fabric of our cities. By embedding the sensors like this we can re-engage with the urban fabric and enable new artistic metaphors within city space. The sensors are positioned across the city. Custom made software now enables these sensors to communicate will one another in a network over a proxy server in real time. Control to the hardware is opened up.The data is also used to create visualizations in an open source environment. Other online users can also re- interpret the data and interrogate the various sensors in the network as this is open source as well (see xml streams). Representations of these data sets will allow unique understanding of the urban environment and environment in real time.Motes are used to collect the data. The 'motes' are tiny wireless sensor boards that gather data and communicate to the central server. The real world is monitored and the data stored in my archive retrieval system. Motes and sensor boards sense the micro incidents of change in the weather, the noise traffic flows and people flows. The interactions of all this data, controlled via bespoke interfaces re-form and re-contextualise experiences in real time.Sensity incorporates the holistic city system. The sense city is a city full of accumulated incidents; of love, abuse and death, fundamentally of change. The micro incidents of change in the weather, the noise traffic flows and people flows are all potential sources for inquiry.A new city experience results based on the mash up meta data from these multiple cities streams. Sensity leverages these real time data city and represents it online, showing the life of the system, opening up the system, and the publishing emerging changing bahaviours of the space. As all things becomes connected and networked, this concept will be become a system that senses not just the city but the whole world. Eventually sensors will be linked to give a real time global visualization. ~ Public domain data resource for art and environmental monitoring.Artworks using data from the real time environment.  New metaphors relevant to the experience of the city.Various types of data can be re-imagined within the context of city space and the environment. This includes pollution data recorded via sensors in the street, to create audio acoustic files expressing the pain and suffering of the air as it pollutes. Weather and forecast data, acquired via weather station equipment; this can be used and can create ambient soundscapes and morphing visualizations as the wind shifts direction or the rain increases. Noise monitor levels, and noise maps , create a symphony of true urban sounds that can be used to make sound reactive sculptures. The patterns we make, the forces we weave, are all being networked into retrievable data structures that can be re-imagined and sourced for information. These patterns all disclose new ways of seeing the world. Environmental monitoring and controlled surveyed city space.The increase of technology infrastructure in the daily existence of a city means that technology will, more than ever be everywhere in our environment. Data mining will be part of the fabric of the landscape. Everything is or will be tracked. CCTV, car sensors, tracking inside our phones and id card movement tracking in the guise of anti- terror activity. The patterns we make, the forces we weave, are all being networked into retrievable data structures that can be re-imagined and source for information. These patterns all disclose new ways of seeing the world. The value of information will be a new currency as power change.The central issue that is developing is the privilege and access to these data sources. Will these systems be open or closed? New maps are being drawn up that re define the digital borders, who is going to want to own this.http://www.stanza.co.uk/sensity/index.html A series of artworks based on sensing the environment. The results are the visualisation and sonification of real time spaces.Sensity artworks are made from the data that is collected across the urban and environment infrastructure. The sensors interpret the micro-data of the interactive city. The output from the sensors display the ""emotional"" state of the city online in real time and the information is also used to create offline installations and sculptural artworks. Several artworks have been made, and several new physical cities are in development for 2009.These artworks represent the movement of people, pollution in the air, the vibrations and sounds of buildings. They are in effect emergent social sculptures visualizing the emotional state of the city.

Shmoogle is a Google randomiser. When you type your query into Shmoogle, you get Google's results but.... in random order!This tool touches upon several crucial issues on the web such as Search Engine Optimization. Shmoogle instantly neutralizes Page rank and the whole SEO industry induced by it.Yet it addresses other fundamental issues such as retrievability vs. visibility. While all pages on the net are equally retrievable,  they are certainly not equally visible.  Every page is accessible by directly typing its URL, independent of Google, but how visible is it? how often does this page appear among Google's first results? Shmoogle breaks this strict hierarchy, and by doing this it promotes the diversity of the web. Since every result has the same chance of being on Shmoogle's first page, results of a more common nature have a bigger chance of appearing first. This is actually polling the web for its view on the query. Shmoogle sacrifices Google's accuracy for a web democracy, and gives common web authors an equal chance of exposure.You might want to try it out with some examples, let' take ""art"" for example. Google's first page consists of the Metropolitan museum, The National Gallery, MoMA, and some art portals on the web (not much of a surprise). On shmoogle, a (possible) first page features  sites entitled "" we make money not art"", ""Olga's gallery"", and ""Art Passions"", among others - did you know these sites exist? This diversity and the uncertainty factor (it is in fact the first non-deterministic search engine) add a feeling of freedom, excitement, and playfulness.

Directly underneath the LEDs is a 2 foot long motorized wooden rover outfitted with a wireless camera pointing upwards to the LEDs.  Viewers can walk up to the LED array and watch the rover move under the lights or they can sit under the arced screen in a soft pillowed environment and watch the live images from the rover's wireless camera. Under the screen viewers are surrounded by 6 channels of audio--four speakers play audio files from the Cassini space probe entering the atmosphere of Titan and two speakers play a live transcription of the rover's video signal. Viewers are able to drive the rover forward and reverse using a joystick available under the screen. As the rover is driven under the LEDs a networked printer in an adjacent space continuously prints stills from the video signal. In this installation common objects are networked together to create an imaginary universe of stars and planets. Through this technological mediation of ordinary objects subtle distinctions are invoked between the perceived and the known. The space of the gallery is transformed into an immersive installation where reframed video and sound occupy the space of the arced screen while opposite to the screen the rover systematically navigates the array of planets and LEDs hanging from the ceiling. The experience is further mediated as the printed stills documenting isolated moments from the rover's journey pile up in another space. The illusion of traveling though outer space is created through this placement of objects and signals, which in turn creates the conditions in which the viewer's spatial orientation can be disrupted. In Sidereal Projections I explore the experiential condition in which two cognitive spaces are occupied at once: the physical space of one's environment in which they are located, and the intangible space that one inhabits when they are using their imagination. Within these two states one is never removed from the other, there is a constant tension between the two. To simulate this phenomena the installation is constructed so that the viewers are constantly shifting between the physical and imagined. As they are visually and aurally immersed under the arc the physical location becomes secondary, but once they start to use the joystick and navigate the rover through the gallery the illusion falls away and location becomes primary.",6/12/07 0:00,http://lincolnlab.net/sidereal.html,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,,6/12/07 0:00,,,"canada, Cassini, Conceptual, constructed reality, constructed space, everyday objects, experience, found objects, illusion, imagination, immersion, live video, mediation, navigation, perception, planets, Projections, robot, sidereal, simulation, space, space travel, stars, surround sound, Telematic, universe, Video Pool Inc."43122,Sigmund's Laundry,Jessica,Gomula,Jessica Gomula,"Are Freud's intimates just more dirty laundry?

Listening to the sound of bridge cables, the voice of each bridge is heard as an instrument for an expanded urban musical experience, a Global Bridge Symphony. 'The city is our temple, electronic networks our religion and the sound of the bridge cables is the voice of the divine.' The bridge echoes with a secret language, listen in to the vibrations within the structure: songs of the inaudible, inexpressible, desires and dreams, the voices of those who have crossed or passed over. ‚ÄúAs harps for the winds of heaven, my weblike cables are spun.‚ÄùJoseph B. Strauss, Chief Engineer Golden Gate Bridge (1937)Placing contact microphones directly on the cables, I record and compose the sound from inside the bridge, hearing the unique voice of the structure as wind, traffic and tension create vibrations. The research proposal draws on my practice of developing connections, recording and composing with the sounds of bridges across the world. Creating site specific installations, performances and events that tap into the intimate geography of their location while also linking them to a global and historic axis. More than simply the acoustic properties or harmonics in the wires, the sound is also the voice of the bridge. This philosophical approach creates a deep engagement between the physical sound of the structure and related stories, social interaction and live events and their cultural context. The bridge echoes with a secret language of the vibrations within the structure, songs of the inaudible and inexpressible, desires and dreams, the voices of those who have crossed or jumped into the river below. Every bridge is connected to all other bridges through the vibrations in their structure. Stretching the boundaries of art and technology across geographical and architectural borders into a new acoustic form. All bridges resonate with a secret music, transmitting and receiving messages, codes and signals, heard through the sounds of bridges in multiple locations. Voice and vibration. Concrete and abstract. A sensual aurality. Immersed in the world by your ear. Going beyond country borders, without seeking to collect and represent the sounds of each bridge into a structured hierarchy, or impose order from above in a singular artist composer viewpoint, but gathering, amplifying, connecting and disseminating a multiplicity of voices in freely evolving form.While bridges form connections between places, cultures and people, they remain grounded in their own local social and cultural contexts. The bridge is a symbol resonant with meaning, myth and personal significance. Exploring the philosophy of bridges, how their form and meaning travels is an ongoing creative enquiry throughout ‚ÄúSinging Bridges‚Äù. Connecting people, places and cultures, bridges are always singing, all we need to do is stop and listen. Singing Bridges explores the spirit and poetry of bridges, how form and meaning travels through sound, light and image in their design and locations as urban sonic sculptures.  Echoing the telecommunications wires circling the earth, the cables of suspension and stay-cabled bridges reverberate with unexpected sounds, each structure creates its own memorable rhythmic texture and sonic environment. The sound of the cables is the voice of the bridge, singing their concrete music, stories of the life and memory of the structure. Jodi Rose recorded the cables on the Anzac Bridge in 1995, while the bridge was still under construction during her studies at Sydney College of the Arts. Ever since then she dreamed of creating a Global Bridge Symphony, listening to the sounds of bridges singing to each other across the globe. In her ongoing process of responding to the specifics of the structure and location, Rose embraces a philosophy of Art in Context, working in collaboration with artists, researchers, engineers and architects, linking places and people.Imagining the cables of suspension and stay-cabled bridges as telegraph wires stretching across the globe, Rose hears in the sound of the vibrations the voice of the bridge, each singing a unique song. Her dream is to connect these signals through technological and human networks, linking the sounds of bridges in specific locations to create a metaphoric and actual Global Bridge Symphony. http://welcometobridgeland.com/http://jodirose.wordpress.com/about/https://soundcloud.com/jodirosehttp://archive.org/details/SingingBridges",4/1/02 0:00,http://www.singingbridges.net/,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,Date created: 2002-04-01,4/1/02 0:00,,,"cultural acoustics, sound art, art in context, psycho-geography, singing bridges, architecture, sonic, global"8533,sistergemini.com,carla,gannis,carla gannis,"http://www.sistergemini.com is an online journal/sketchbook kept for posting thoughts, sketches, and animations that act as the resource and process material for an ever expanding multi-media story about the life and web performance work of Princess, aka Sister Gemini, (aka Carla Gannis).

(from New Museum website: http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/dina-kelberman-smoke-fire)Kelberman‚Äôs original website features an ever-growing grid of gifs (at the time of launch, there are seven hundred total)‚Äîeach one an image of smoke or fire excerpted from an iconic cartoon (the list now includes The Smurfs, The Simpsons, Tom & Jerry, Darkwing Duck, Rocky & Bullwinkle, and many more). The project is hatched out of the artist‚Äôs obsessive online surfing‚Äîfor this project, she located and sampled hundreds of cartoons out of the thousands that she chose‚Äîas well as out of a desire to order and rearrange the seemingly endless amount of information available to her. The gif images are linked not strictly by subject matter but also through more free-form visual associations, like form, color, and shape. The resulting work is a psychic tour of disasters as they are pictured to children (and/or other cartoon enthusiasts). Here, the successive images of smoke and fire pose no threat.Much has been written about the withering aspects of the web‚Äôs surfeit of information. But for Kelberman, like so many other artists, this visual excess and the process of surfing through it is an inspiration. This tendency has been covered by the New Museum before: In 2007, the Museum copresented a show (also organized by Lauren Cornell) with Rhizome called ‚ÄúProfessional Surfer‚Äù that explored this process of surfing the web as an emergent practice. More recently, curator Domenico Quaranta organized ‚ÄúCollect the WWWorld: The Artist as Archivist in the Internet Age,‚Äù which began at the Link Center in Brescia, Italy, before traveling to New York. On the exhibition, Quaranta has written: ‚ÄúMass media has now been replaced by a mass of mediators. Art is not responding to what they [the mediators] do with a more professional and technically advanced use of the same tools, but is instead refining its own languages and codes.‚Äù His point is key to contextualizing Smoke & Fire in a history of appropriation and within contemporary practice. Where earlier artists unveiled the inherent politics or ideologies in TV or advertising, often artists today engage amateur (i.e., consumer) engagements with pop culture by amplifying the impulses to collect and re-represent aspects of it.Smoke & Fire, and previous works by Kelberman, manifest the feeling of drifting or surfing online by compiling images along lines that reflect the way we wander through information online, which can either follow or work against the way images are indexed by search engines. For instance, I‚Äôm Google (2011‚Äìongoing) is a tumblr blog in which Kelberman compiles batches of images and videos into a stream-of-consciousness grid that moves seamlessly from one subject to the next, from uniformed workers standing in formation, to sand castles, to craters, to mountains. For Blue Clouds (2012), Kelberman blurred screenshots of the Star Trek the Next Generation credits, turning each one into what looks like a blue-tinted, erased line in the sky. In Kelberman‚Äôs practice, surfing, searching, saving, and reordering merge into a broader artistic practice that distills shared preoccupations or ways of seeing the world. Smoke & Fire will evolve‚Äîgrowing in number of gifs featured‚Äîwhile it is featured on the New Museum website from February 14 to March 13, 2013.",4/21/13 14:28,http://dinakelberman.com/smokeandfire/,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,,2/1/13 0:00,,,"animated gif, animation, cartoon, collection, smoke, fire, dina kelberman, web"31814,Smoky Hill River Outpost,Tactical,Magic,Center for Tactical Magic,"Infiltrating the heartland of America, the Center for Tactical Magic worked with the Salina Art Center, the City of Salina (Kansas), and a dozen local high school students to construct a 30 ft. surveillance clubhouse directly behind the back of the city park‚Äôs Statue of Liberty.  An amalgam of playhouse, pyramid, pentagon, prison, and panopticon, the multiple-level structure was comprised of various access points, observation areas, and an exotic range of surveillance mechanisms.  Combining high-tech equipment (pinhole cameras, wireless transmitters, thumbprint scan access, radio scanners, electronic bugging devices, and more) with more arcane means of information acquisition (telepathy, astral projection, ouija, tarot, astrology, crystal gazing, and others) the Outpost was the physical manifestation of a fantastical integration of extra-sensory perception.Enclosed within a 120 ft. pentagonal perimeter of chainlink fence, the entire structure materialized as a crude pyramid incorporating a mish-mash of construction materials and access points ranging from gates and sliding bookcases to two-way mirrors and false doorways.  The lowest of the three levels consisted of the central security gate, the yard (with sprinkler), a peep nook, the Audio Surveillance Chamber (ASC), and the Comfortable Containment Unit (CCU) which included a camouflage couch, tinted security domes, a mounted pig‚Äôs head with secret snout-cam, and a clear-cased prison TV (that received a wireless feed from a camera mounted on Liberty‚Äôs bosom at the park‚Äôs entrance).  Level two granted access to the observation deck, the Genie (a 30 ft scissor lift which provided a bird‚Äôs eye view of the park), and the Control Room which featured multiple surveillance monitors, police and cell phone scanners,  a crystal ball with a video feed, and coffee & donuts (the fuel of authority).  The third and highest level transcended all mechanisms of control and provided occupants with a heightened perspective from the top of the pyramid. The Smoky Hill River Outpost was envisioned simultaneously as 1) a critical attempt to construct a home in a land of security; 2) an innocent-looking, temporary autonomous zone that features an arsenal of tactical tools; 3) a gateway to the liberatory potential of the magical and creative arts; 4) a social experiment examining and exposing the inherent manipulations attached to issues of security; and 5) an easily-consumed and entertaining gesture that encourages the close examination and breaching of security systems.  To fully realize these goals, the Center for Tactical Magic also coordinated several events at the Outpost, including: a free Dance Party featuring local DJs; a Graffiti Workshop for teens; a drop-in tour of Target‚Äôs security system; Restricted-Access Periods (boys only, girls only, kids only, teens only, adults only); and an Astral Projection Workshop where participants infiltrated the White House and other restricted sites using their astral bodies. Together, the magical and the technological joined forces to explore the relationship between homeland security and the mystification of technology.",6/5/02 0:00,http://tacticalmagic.org/CTM/project%20pages/Outpost.htm,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/31814/project_pages/Outpost.htm,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"Date created: 2002-06-05Date cloned: 2013-04-24",6/5/02 0:00,,,"Center for Tactical Magic, Collaborative, collider, community, contextual, HTML, installation, interact, Kansas, Participatory, performance, privacy, public space, resistance, Salina, Salina Art Center, security, Smoky Hill River Festival, social space, surveillance, tactical, tactical media, The Smoky Hill River Outpost, video"47702,Snow Stories,Jillian,Mcdonald,jillian mcdonald,"Snow Stories is a database driven story engine, which uses appropriated and original film clips, images, animation, and sound to translate the viewer's written story into a visual narrative.",12/31/05 0:00,http://jillianmcdonald.net/snowstories,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,,12/31/05 0:00,,,"Animation, Antartica, Appropriation, Arctic, canada, Dr Zhivago, Fargo, film, Interactive art, Internet, nature, North, Snow, stories, The Shining, Winter, writing"2075,snowcrash,antonio,mendoza,Antonio Mendoza,"An anti-everything browser hijacker.

My recent work deconstructs these tendencies. I take as point of departure that this development is not a natural evolution but a convoluted series of choices, based on social, political, economical, and scientific concepts that are often perceived as inevitable. In these recent projects I am attempting to reconstruct the concepts of the camera and acknowledge and magnify the collaborative roll the camera and the computer play in the creation of digital imagery. The social metronome is a project that deconstructs the image created by an optical and digital device, namely the camcorder. The footage is created by the computer application in conjunction with the camera and shows images that are created by movement. In these images people (also birds, cats, cars, and bikes) are barely individually recognizable but instead become figures constructed by their individual movement pattern.  This way of observation is not a 'natural' inclination of the camera. (This natural inclination being a focus on form and a clear distinction of foreground and background, an optical image.) But is a reconstruction of this vision through the logical propositions of  programming language in conjunction with the optical vision of a camera.

Tibetan prayer flags are made of colorful squares of cotton fabric imprinted with the images of ""mantras"", or sacred sounds. They are hung outdoors where the breeze blowing through them can ""activate"" the sounds, sending them out around the world on the wind. When I learned about these flags, I was reminded of childhood experiences aboard small racing sailboats. Oftentimes we'd use short strands of cassette tape tied to the rigging as wind indicators, or ""tell-tails"". Cassette tape is ideal for this purpose as it is light and very sensitive to the wind, it‚Äôs extremely durable, and it dries quickly. As a kid, I used to imagine that if the wind hit the tell-tails just right, the sounds of whatever had been recorded onto the tape (Cat Stevens? The Beatles?) could be heard wafting out into the air. Much later when I learned about the prayer flags, I remembered the cassette tape tell-tails and sensed a direct relationship between the two. I was immediately inspired to marry the two concepts to create a fabric that had sonic potential literally woven into it. I immediately set about collecting and recording tapes of music and sounds that had been influential to me throughout my life...the Beatles, Bob Dylan, Miles Davis, Beethoven, Laurie Anderson, ocean surf, my high-school punk band. At first I knitted with the tape, but the texture of the resulting fabric was very loose and flimsy. Finally a weaver friend offered to try using the tape on a loom at the Rhode Island School of Design. The product astounded both of us. We never expected such a beautiful, tightly-woven, functional material. At first I'd intended to make a string of my own sort of nautical/Buddhist-inspired flags from the original samples, but before I could begin working on the project, the fabric had been accepted into a show of artworks made from repurposed materials at Felissimo Design House in New York City. For that show in 2003 I constructed my first ""sonic shaman-superhero dress"" from the panels of fabric, which I came to realize, were actually audible...the fabric retains it's magnetic properties throughout the weaving process, and when a tape head is dragged along its surface, it emits a garbled, underwater-like sound.Seven years have elapsed since then, and Sonic Fabric has been included in exhibitions in galleries and museums around the world related to sound art, recycling and repurposing, technology, and fashion. It has appeared on the Sundance Channel‚Äôs ‚ÄúBig Ideas for a Small Planet‚Äù, and on the ‚ÄúToday Show‚Äù. It‚Äôs been featured in the New York Times, Orion Magazine, People, MAKE Magazine, Treehugger, and many others. In 2003 I was commissioned to make a dress for Jon Fishman, percussionist for the band Phish, which he wore and played on stage during a concert in Las Vegas.As a conceptual artist and a musician, I am constantly collecting and experimenting with the sounds that are recorded onto the tape before it‚Äôs woven into fabric. The current batches of fabric are recorded with the ‚ÄúBetween Stations‚Äù album, a collection of sound collages composed of loops and layers of samples collected over a 5 year period on and under the streets of Manhattan and Brooklyn. ‚ÄúBetween Stations‚Äù is music literally made from the sounds of the city, and is intended as an ode to life in post-9/11 New York.As the Sonic Fabric project has grown, I have felt compelled to share the material with others ‚Äì I believe that art should, if possible, be used and enjoyed as part of everyday life. To this end, I have begun to sell yardage of Sonic Fabric to architects, fashion, interiors, and accessories designers for use in their own projects. I am also working with Julio Cesar, a New York fashion designer and a dear friend, on a line of wearable, functional items, such as the Sonic Fabric necktie (an incognito good-vibe emitting wardrobe accessory/work of conceptual art in one). In 2006 I relocated from Brooklyn, NY to the high desert of far west Texas (near the town of Marfa made famous by Donald Judd and the minimalists of the 1970‚Äôs) for its unique land-, light- and soundscape, and in order to more actively pursue experiments into sustainability, conservation, and permaculture. My studio consists of a reoutfitted 1970‚Äôs school bus tucked into a grove of ponderosa pines. Solar panels run sound and computer equipment and a sewing machine. A greenhouse and other outbuildings made of scrap materials, rainwater harvesting tanks, graywater systems, and compost piles are in a constant state of evolution, along with sound, installation, and video projects. This ever-growing array of life and art projects is affectionately called ‚ÄúThe Center for the Improbable & (Im)Permacultural Research.More info on Sonic Fabric can be found at the following sites:http://www.alycsantoro.comhttp://www.sonicfabric.comhttp://www.supermarkethq.com/designer/6140/productshttp://www.youtube.com/alyceobvioushttp://www.cdbaby.com/cd/alycesantoro i draw from my experiences in art, science, and music to explore the place where the quantifiable and the intangible overlap. My sound collages, found-object sculptures, installations and actions are influenced by rituals and techniques used by scientists, shamans, and philosophers to access, study, and interact with that which cannot be examined by ""conventional"" means. Using cast-off ephemera and common household items I perform ""unconventional"" investigations into the nature of reality. My work often contains a hidden element that is revealed by closer examination, or by interacting with the piece. This is the case, for example, with my works on ""sonic fabric"", a material woven from prerecorded audiocassette tape. The fabric retains its magnetism, and the pieces made from it can be ""listened to"" by dragging a tape head over its surface. I compile and make collages of sounds that I then record onto the the tape I use to weave with. The sounds are collected from a wide range of sources: musical, ambient, spoken word. I intend for them to be documents of the human experience, stored snippets of our sonic sensory existence. The project was inspired by quantum physics, Tibetan prayer flags, and the use of small strands of tape as ""tell-tails"", wind-indicators used on sailboats.

Real time images are fed into a software system where a series of specialized channels rework these images to create unique visuals. The channels are always on, and always changing, a constant view evolving around the clock. The data is never the same, it is always changing. The changing light and ephemeral qualities of the city urban landscape are morphed (using CCTV cameras set up in the public domain) to create real time blended collages.- Soul uses CCTV camera networks and environmemental data from sensors to re-imagine, to re visualize the urban environment.- The idea is to capture the soul of the city and represent these images/ data as a piece of sculpture in a constantly evolving data sculpture.-This data sculpture is a live real time evolving or generative artwork.

This stretches the digital arts to also evolve at an equal pace, while also raising the deeper issues which ride beneath the wave of our data driven existence. Through my research I explore another dimension, investigating directly and in real time the dynamic of the social space. The artworks relate to current data flows in the environments I monitor. My research utilizes systems that can be used to gather information via sensors or CCTV cameras in the field. This data is harnessed to visualize the urban environments and spatial representations as a dynamic real time experience rather than as a recorded 'photograph' of the city space.I am attempting to move on towards a point where the landscape is a hybridized audio visual representation of the space. ie, an audio visual experience based on the sounds and sights of the city pollution, noise, traffic data , that are captured via these sensor networks.How we understand and value information is of great importance. It seems reasonable to suggest that visual metaphors might simplify our understanding of data in space. By adopting visual and poetic metaphors for gathered data this enables a perspective which Masayuki Fujihata calls a 'parallel reality', a multi point perspective. (Reference: In conversation with Stanza in Tokyo November 2003 as part of his presentation). He achieved this by using multiple participants walking with field devices and recording the outdoor spaces. His result can be compared to a film of an event, a history.I want to make my work eternally current. It will allow a real time multiple perspective of an identified space.In terms of artworks online I would actually cite my own work as being a leading exponent in audio visual interfaces. I have made a number works that address issues of real time data and what I call the emergent properties of city space. (see.www.stanza.co.uk).

So it was only natural for the 2 ideas come together.  The system is composed of a location system that estimates the location of the ""listener"" on the wall in an indoor environment, the positions of users with ""senders,"" and a sound system that feeds back into the speakers. In the case that the user enters a zone of the location system, the user's ""sender"" transmits supersonic waves to the ""listeners"" on the wall, and the master server measures the position based on the distance estimation subroutine in the middleware layer. After the master server has calculated the position of the users in the location system zone, the results are sent using OSC protocols to the media application located on the application layer. In order to apply the location system media content, we considered the design and implementation of the location system. This system was demonstrated using a sound installation. ""Sound Jewelry"" is an environment that consists of two layers of sound. In the foreground layer, ""melodies"" are dynamically generated by measuring the distances between the participants that are wearing sensors. In the background layer, ""accompaniments"" are automatically generated using the distance data in order to support the ambient environment. When many people move in a 4-by-6 m space, the sound only changes based on the nearest relative distance. However, as the number of people increases, the sound changes become more complex. Sound complexity was used as part of the installation. Users recognized sound changes as they moved in real time in the space.  The term ""Sound Jewelry"" was coined by Iwatake, one of the authers of this installation.

There are countless programs and email techniques to ""block"" spam, however some always gets through.  The sheer numbers make it impossible to control.  Once the junk mail arrives, the task is not complete.  Marketing people, psychologists and hi-end internet programmers, brainstorm ways to get recipients to actually open these sales solicitations.The companies sending junk messages regularly use methods far beyond the capabilities of most recipients, even most programmers.  Why?  Surely, if the recipients simply do not want these messages, why would anyone go to ridiculous lengths to trick those same recipients into opening them?In this piece, the user enters an email address (preferably their own) sends 15 junk messages from the address submitted.  the subjects also contain the email account name with one of 200+ unpredictable spoof subjects.  for example: ""hey jdoe, earn viagra working from home"".  These are common techniques that have traditionally been used by spammers and prank spoofers.So, what exactly differentiates this, by calling it ""art"".  rather than admit spam is annoying, does this justify ""free speech""?  can the point of censorship both be to stifle voices AND eliminate ideological camouflage/noise that prevents people from seeing clearly.  Certainly there would be no windshield wipers on  cars, if not for censorship.Once opened, the body of the emails question the very use of email, when one is never sure which to read.  Why do people choose to make it increasingly impossible or impractical to sort the important information from the trivial sales pitches.  by rendering email ultimately less useful, isn't that just like setting your own boat afire mid-sea?Is email gradually destroying the use for email itself, to result in us abandoning the desire for email.  Or are the sensory and cognitive features that appear unique to humans paradoxically an ever-evolving filtering system, unaware of our surroundings.

Usually, Maren and Sara used make-up every time before going out. The day in which this action occurs, Sara had to leave again.

Primarily intended as a project to facilitate personal healing through the work of reconstructing and speaking of a difficult shared history, ""steps to the moon"" also highlighted the tensions between the private and the public, the personal and the political, specifically so because of the opressive/repressive conditions that inform the shaping of these dichatomies in Iran as in elsewhere. The project came to a halt when the collaborator in Iran, a university student, lost her internet priviledges.

The Generative Art mediated for software, it's come to be a new problem, the question of the authorship that would not exist without a data base created by the author. The data base deals with the commands, allowing configuring some new authorial forms. The digital imagem as a load computer science, that is pixel loads information that can or not to modernize itself. The project is also based on the concept of Game.

Do an art market simulation based in four mecanism of speculation around the artist and its art work. The first mecanism is an stock exchange auction of artist participations, them behave like enterprises and the users can buy and sell artist shares. The second mecanism are the ranking points, each user can assign this points to the artist it prefer and make an direct influence in the shares and art work prices, the number of point depends the personality it has.  The third mecanism es the buy and sell art works process produced by the artist, the art works are auctioned and buyed by the users and exposed and selled throught the galeries and museums managed by the own participants model. The fourth mecanism is the information, it has three levels: public opinion, specialized opinion and critic, each of it can influence in the shares and art work prices behavior.StartThe home page shows a general view of the virtual art market through  general indicators in graphs (3) like: top prestige galleries, more important museums, top ranking artist, artists with more volume of sold shares and total volume of negotiated shares.  In the bottom are the articles of critic and specialized opinion.  And in the left column appear the more recent auctions of work and the access to the complete statistical information of the artist.  This set of information tries to give a general concept of the buttons that move the art market. It fix in the participants mind of the market in a numerical form and informational form, dematerializing the work and the artist.The first step to become a participant of the simulator is to register itself (a) (the access to the registry is in the home page(1)).Once registered the following step it is to sign in (Also in the main page(2)) In case of wanting to prove a galerist personality the data are: e-mail: joanprats@galeria.compassword: galeriaThe system when validating the data will give access to the entrance page(4).  When initiating the participant has an investor personality.  The simulator assigns virtual money to him for its transactions (100,000).  Relative to the daily life each person needs to spend daily in food, rent, etc.  To the participant a daily quota is received to him that is reduced of its money available.  Important!

These points directly affect the value of the artist shares and works.(Detail explained ahead in ‚ÄúAllocation of Ranking Points‚Äù)3.Artist:  This option allows to look for the artists who are in the simulator alphabetically and by artistic discipline.  When giving a click in the name of the found artist can reach the detailed statistical information.4.Global Indicators:  This option takes to the screen of the virtual art market general indicators: Total volume of negotiated shares, Cash flow, Amount of negotiated work, Top prestige galleries and Top important museums.5.Contacts:  Are the participants who have known attending the exhibitions.(Detail explained ahead in ‚ÄúKnown‚Äù)6.Press and Critic: Are critic and press articles published in Internet and by the participants of the model with personality of Critic.7.Specialized Opinon: Are the articles of specialized opinion, written by the participants of the model with personality of specialized opinion.8.Exhibitions:  Through this option it is possible to be attended the exhibitions that at the moment are active in the simulator.  In these, work through auction can be bought and it is possible to be known other participants.  Only the participants with Gallery and Museum personalities are available to organize exhibitions. Will appear to them the button to create, to publish and to erase exhibitions.9.Publicity to buy:  The exhibitions have a space to publicite other participants.  This with the purpose which other participants know the buyer of the publicity without be present in the exhibition all along.10.Auctions/Loan Neg:  Through this option the proprietor of a work negotiates with other participants the conditions of auction and loan of his work.11.My Stock Auctions:  Through this option visualize the bids that other participants have proposed for the artist stock auctions.

Therefore the simulator allows to know other participants through the exhibitions.  At the start the participant don‚Äôt know anybody.  It is necessary to know and to interact with other participants to be able to auction work and shares, to interchange information, to make more money.  In order to know other participants, exhibitions have to attend, and is necessary to try to establish contact with other participant (This through a chat window which it appears in the exhibition page) and to pay a quota to know it.  Both pay a quota.  This refers to that in the real market, to meet firstly both people must agree in making contact and second an investment is necessary in:  clothes, food, transport, etc. to know itself.  There is an additional information of the participant that appear, who treats to compensate the prejudices that another person are when being in front of, the race, sex and sexual preference.  The participant can see his listing of known participants and send messages  to them through the option of menu -Contacts- (1) in the entrance page.Allocation of Ranking PointsIn the art market there are people and institutions that exert a great direct influence in the speculation of the work of an artist, so is the case of some museums, galleries, critical or collectors.  The ranking points is one of the mechanisms of speculation of the model, these resemble this phenomenon that characterizes the real art market and  transform it into a tool in the virtual model so the participant has the capacity of influence.  The participant based on his personality and prestige is the number of points that has to his disposition, can assign them to one or several artists and to change them when ever is wished.  This is made through the option  -Ranking- (2) in the menu of the entrance page.Shares Auctions CycleThe second speculative mechanism that influences in the value of the artist work is the transaction of shares.  This it is the mechanism which I propose like own of the Internet, virtual market, and in that as much the process as the work and the artist are dematerialize and become in information and numbers solely.  For each artist the simulator emits a pool of shares that represent it.  In this first auction all the artists have the same amount of shares to the same value.  In agreement the auction is developed, the price low and raise according to the free supply and demand.  The participants who buy shares can auction them at any time.  The cycle of transaction of shares is the following oneArt Works Auctions Cycle The third mechanism of speculation that is used by the participants is the artist work transaction.  This it is a simulated process taken from the real market. The works are auctioned by the galleries.  The proprietors of works look for a gallery to sell their works.  The galleries organize exhibitions so that the potential buyers place their proposal of purchase.  It is adjudged to who the proprietor considers that makes the best bid.  The cycle of work auction is the following oneInformation CycleThe information is the fourth mechanism that influences in the value of the artist work and shares.  The information is handled at three levels of specialization in the simulator:  first it is the public information that it is written by any participant of the model, the second level is the specialized opinion that is written by the participants with personality of the same name and third it is the critic that is written by the participants with personality of critic.  This last one is placed in the same section that the press.  What attempt when mixing the press(information of the real market) with the critic (information of the virtual market) it is to begin to erase the line that distinguishes both worlds.All the information is published in the options of Public opinion, Specialized opinion and Press & Critic (a) that appear in the page that details the information of each artist, in the main page and in the menu options  -Press and Critic- and -Specialized Opinion- of the entrance page.",8/20/04 0:00,http://www.stockartist.net,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: art market, simulation, stock market, Date created: 2004-08-20",8/20/04 0:00,,,"Anti-art, ars telematica, Art Market, Claudia Giannetti, Conceptual, corporate, DHTML, education, email, Feilke, game, HTML, Javascript, Participatory, Pau Brown, Roy Scott, Siegfried Schmidt, Stefan Jensen, Virtual, Virtual reality, Visual, William Bricken"46891,Stone Days,,,Barbara  Todd,"Stone Days is a diary of days.

By such means, she addresses canonical subjects in modern painting: the traditional relation between artist and model, the purported autonomy and nonreferentiality of abstract art, the topos of the heroic, gestural painter. The grandiose rhetoric that obscures, inflates, or mythifies these subjects is deftly dismantled by an incisive irreverence, while the art itself is reaffirmed in an homage admittedly more spirited and saucy than reverential. Invited to make a work for the world wide web Donegan characteristically decided to approach her abiding subject through a language specific to this new medium. By opting to use low tech devices peculiar to the web, such as gif animations, frames, refreshes, and mouse-overs, she focused on the basic tools integral to this medium. Taking as her starting point a mainstay of art practice, the studio visit, Donegan offers viewers the opportunity to construct their own version of this highly codified ritual, albeit as an encounter at a virtual site. Drawing on some of her favorite motifs, the detergent bottle/camera, the signature mark of the artist, the stripe and other generic motifs from past painting, and elsewhere, in the commercial world, she presents viewers with a multitude of means by which to navigate this site and track their quarry. Just as studio visits typically meander episodically from topic to topic, or devolve into an erratic, unstructured archeological probe, or wander off into circuitous labyrinthine paths that bypass the artist's key concerns so viewers to Studio Visit may find themselves circling uncertainly round several miscellaneous subjects, returning unexpectedly to others, or becoming deflected, sidetracked or even stonewalled by others. That such visits abruptly interrupt the ongoing flow of creativity is wryly attested in the fractured sequence of photographs, shot over the course of a day of the artist alone at work in her studio, which unfold when the visitor occupies the site. While in pursuit of those revelatory truths purportedly vouchsafed in a visit to the inner sanctum, the site and source of creativity, viewers are never permitted to lose themselves in an ""authentic encounter"": images of cameras and of film frames constantly indicate the mediated character of this meeting. What ensues may at first appear a disarmingly direct, playful and revealing introduction to this artist and her preoccupations, but as in all her practice, the work soon declares its self-reflexivity as the languages, genres, and codes of the art form are turned back on themselves. The search -- the process -- consequently proves more rewarding than any endpoint. Irrespective of whether solutions or revelations were sought, closures, for Donegan, are necessarily artificial, temporary, and provisional. [This project was commissioned by Dia Center for the Arts.] In her first online project for the Dia Center, video artist Cheryl Donegan invites us in for a ""Studio Visit.""",8/29/01 16:45,http://www.diacenter.org/donegan/index.html,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,,8/29/01 16:45,,,"Animation, archive, Cheryl Donegan, Dia, Documentary, homepage, HTML, identity, Studio Visit, Visual"22279,stuttering,nathaniel,stern,nathaniel stern,"According George Lakoff, author of Philosophy In The Flesh, human communication is always already mediated. Our emotions, our past and the memories it carries, cannot be separated from it. He says, ‚ÄúThe mind is inherently embodied.‚Äù Because of our flesh, our multi-sensory perception, and our personal experiences, our communications convey much more than transparent information.stuttering, an interactive installation, proposes a space which accents how we effect, and are affected by, conversation and comprehension. It suggests that stillness and stumbling play a role in the un/realized potentials of memory and storytelling.Computer printouts are scattered about the floor, containing quotes and passages about stutterers, situations in which stuttering, in its broadest sense, is common, and suggestions of when and where we should ‚Äúmake stutters,‚Äù in order to break ‚Äúseamless‚Äù communication. Each viewer in the space triggers a large-scale interactive art object projected on the wall in front them. This projection is broken into a Mondrian-like mirror, where each sub-section, initialized by body-tracking software, animates one of the floor-found quotes; every animation is accompanied by an audio recitation of its text.stuttering thus creates a tense environment through its inescapable barrage of stuttering sound and visual stuttering: noise. Only by lessening their participation will the information explosion slow into an understandable text for the viewer. The piece asks them not to interact, but merely to listen. Their minimal movements, and the phrases they trigger, literally create new meaning.The spaces between speaking and listening, between language and the body, add to the complex experience of communication. stuttering is not displaying data, but rather, pushing us to explore these practices of speaking and listening. It suggests that communication comes to and from us, in ways that even we do not fully comprehend. An interactive installation saturated with trigger points of spoken word and animated text.

SVEN was first created as a performance and performed in 2006. It was then upgraded and adapted as an installation in 2007. SVEN-the-installation came out of retirement briefly in 2010-2011. SVEN (Surveillance Video Entertainment Network) is a real-time computer vision and surveillance system that detects ‚Äúlikely rock stars‚Äù among pedestrians and generates music videos based upon their features. SVEN is a public space project, exhibited in both stationary locations and as a performance in a van-based ‚ÄúSVEN Mobile Unit.‚ÄùThe SVEN system is comprised of of a camera, monitor, and two computers that can be set up in public places - especially in situations where a CCTV monitor might be expected. The software consists of a custom computer vision application that tracks pedestrians and detects their characteristics, and a real-time video processing application that receives this information and uses it to generate music-video like visuals from the live camera feed. The resulting video and audio are displayed on a monitor in the public space, interrupting the standard security camera type display each time a potential rock star is detected. The idea is to humorously examine and demystify concerns about surveillance and computer systems not in terms of being watched, but in terms of how the watching is being done - and how else it might be done if other people were at the wheel..There's also the other side of the SVEN coin: when do rock stars look like you?

Several autonomous agents move over a surface, making marks as they move, seen by visitors to the Electrohype exhibition as a realtime two-screen projection.The drawing process is modelled on a simple kinetic system. Each agent has a speed and direction that both smoothly change for every step it takes. When the speed or rate of rotation exceeds the minimum or maximum constraints, they start reversing so that their values tend toward the other extreme, causing a subtle oscillation between values over time. Different values for the constraints result in visually different but recognizably related images.Each image takes an hour to complete. Once an image is done, the surface is cleared, the drawing system is set to a randomized initial state and the drawing process starts over. The images that are created are saved and uploaded to the web every few minutes so that online users can observe the most recent activity. All completed images are saved with a time stamp indicating the time of their creation. An archive documents the whole period of the exhibition.Some physicists define glass not as a solid but rather as a slow-moving liquid, so viscous that we cannot observe its movement.

While RFID is praised as an important profit promising innovation in the industry, privacy advocates demonize it as a threat for society and democracy. The public however, is not included into the discussion although private people might be affected most. Therefore this art installation aims to raise the awareness for RFID and to initiate the participation in the public debate. It offers a narrative approach in order to invite visitors to gain an own experience with RFID. The installation consists of a shelf and tagged everyday objects. Every object tells a story via a fictional software displayed on a screen integrated into the shelf. Visitors can find out that all objects have been stolen by a lady, who now proudly presents them as her ‚Äútrophies‚Äù. Spending more time exploring them, conclusions can be drawn about her personality and her criminal career. Last but not least, the work strongly plays with irony as for decades RFID has been used for anti-theft purposes at retail.",7/1/05 0:00,http://www.bewegungsfrei.de/tagged/content/en/0301_installation_en.html,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: narration,RFID,story,misuse,technologyDate created: 2005-07-01New Keywords from user: RFID,storytellingDate created: 2005-07-01",7/1/05 0:00,,,"archive, Conceptual, Database, Documentary, Flash, Germany, identity, installation, interact, interface, Kerstin von Locquenghien, Narrative, Participatory, privacy, space, Stuttgart, www.bewegungsfrei.de"47290,Take,Emma,Davis,Emma Davis,"Take uses 80 'keywords' from a dating website to explore language and memory, association and generalisation.

On this collaborative blog we invite you to donate TEXT breath. That is, please describe the breath you are taking right now, especially with reference to the weather that is conditioning it.As part of this project we also collect breath in public places. See Collecting Breath. Some are encounters usually in parks and gardens - the lungs of the city. Some breath is collected at events where we invite people to draw breath on paper as well as 'draw' breath into a microphone. About the Project:  ""The air you just exhaled has already spread far and wide. The CO2 from a breath last week may now be feeding a plant on a distant continent, or plankton in a frozen sea. In a matter of months all of the CO2 you just exhaled will have dispersed around the planet.""   Tim Flannery, The Weather MakersTalking About the Weather is an ongoing cross media project sparked by the terrifying spectre of global climate change. Sheer terror at the possibilities that are being talked about led us to 'talking about the weather'.  In this project weathertalk is no longer a banal exchange of local weather forecasts, but instead we ask people to donate their breath - the breath which they would normally use to talk about the weather and the same breath that is spread far and wide as described by Tim Flannery.

Whilst driving along I noticed huge telegraph cables crossing the highway, the highway had high banks either side and these huge cables slung over the highway dipping with a smooth curve. I imagined the cables as a huge double bass and thought about the deep bass sounds that would from strumming these huge cables.ConceptThe concept of this sound toy is to use the strings of a telegraph line as a sound toy, to generate bass tones. The user will play the string by moving the mouse across the strings thus playing a note. The note generated will depend on the position along the string. The volume of the note will depend on how hard they move the mouse across the string.Version 1.0This initial version used maths to ascertain whether the mouse's position above or below the line and when the mouse crossed the line, that triggers the sound to play. The interface also tracks the distance travelled by the mouse between the enter and exit frame events to work out how hard the user had strummed the strings and increases the volume. The position the mouse interacts with the telegraph's string was tracked with the mouse enter and the length of the telegraph's string was divided by 16 to give a plus 8 and minus 8 octave scale on the initial sample used.Version 2.0The revised version gave the control back to the user and was more in keeping with the tactile qualities of a double bass. The strings have to be plucked with a mouse click, this triggers the sound playing. There is a different note for each string and the notes are pitch shifted over a plus or minus scale.OngoingTo improve the interaction and user feedback. To use high quality samples set to an exact note that can be accurately pitch shifted to give correct musical scale. To look at how volume functionality could be a depending on how hard the user pulls at the strings.Extending the ConceptUsing a web cam linked to goggles it would be possible to capture these images in real time. The use could wear a headset and look at telegraph lines and using their hands play the telegraph lines as musical instruments. The level of contrast between the sky and the telegraph line would have to be quite high to calculate the co lour difference between sky and cable, the user would also have to have a glove with either led placed on glove to calculate the position and movement of users hand against the background.

The intersection of spectacle and surveillance evident in contemporary postmodern phenomena like the cult of the celebrity and reality TV is not a new idea. Surveillance has already been sold. The events of September 11 and December 13 (attack on the Indian Parliament in New Delhi) merely clinched the deal. Within hours of the attacks the surveillance industry had mobilized itself. Cloaked behind vague global security rhetoric, it set out with the aim of profiting from a new and improved anxiety economy.The surveillance industry sees India as one of its most lucrative potential markets, with a growth potential of 25% in an industry that already has a turnover of close to US $120 million per annum. On an everday level, CCTVs are cropping up in all the usual places. There is growing excitement about electronic security devices. As Shuddhabrata Sengupta observes, modernising elites in the so-called Third World are often better placed (due to lack of constitutional safeguards to privacy or lack of awareness at the public level of privacy issues) to put in place technologies of mass surveillance. It comes as no surprise then when www.tradeport.org states on its website that ""installation of security devices has gained popularity among the upper segment of Indian society, including the very rich and celebrities who experience security threats. It has become a status symbol to install high-tech safety equipment in homes and residential complexes.""Surveillance is creeping into India almost invisibly, with little discussion and an alarming lack of public awareness. Telematic Surveillance as a project is operating in the context of a country on the periphery of late capitalism. As such, its reach is numerically limited but the significance of those numbers is incredibly wide ranging. Technologies are always, to some extent, linked with capitalist interests and often function as tools of oppression. This makes it increasingly crucial to expose the wired Indian consumer to the underlying power relations inherent in new technologies--in short, to a politics of information.GaiSecurity.com is an intelligent surveillance solutions provider (cum tactical entity) based in Mumbai, India. By offering surveillance as a commodity, Gai attempts to satirise the banalization or popularization of global surveillance. Gai wants to demonstrate the sheer strangeness of this emerging global tele-surveillance market in the public (market) domain and the mechanisms of power that lie behind it by playing it back to itself in a distorted and exaggerated remix. Gai attempts to adopt a pedagogical role, informing its customers of exactly what they might be buying into, by subliminally(?) linking surveillance industry jingle to contesting voices in the network.In subscribing to Gai's Service, Gai's customers implicitly turn from tele-spectators to tele-actors. They become voyeuristic electronic agents and their PC--a personal domestic device--is turned into an apparatus of behaviour control. They may gain permanent direct access and thus control over events, but at a price. They simultaneously become subject to control, and are willingly(?) entered into a spectacular, viral, surveilling loop.Gai, then, is also about digitized subjectivity. Being watched in the information age means more than simply screen. It means database. Both screen and database or digital profile are part of a larger genre of vision technologies that essentially operate by abstracting bodies and/or spaces from their territorial settings and transforming them into abstract flows of data. These flows of data, these images, become the locus of social control; identity becomes locked in reductive, repressive data systems more real than their fleshy referent. People are classified primarily in terms of potential risk, the most obvious being the profiling of those with Arab or Islamic backgrounds.Gai wants to function as a subtle tactical entity exposing the skewed agenda of the continued and uncontested transformation of public bodies into scanned and controlled grids. Technology is not ahistorical; it has dubious modes of power inscribed within its nodes and questionable values encoded in its software. Gai tries to make visible to its customers the collective loss of sight perpetuated by the surveillance society.",1/8/03 0:10,http://www.gaisecurity.com,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"Date created: october 2002Telematic Surveillance was a 2002 Rhizome.org alt.interface commission.

Is it possible to encapsulate an amorphous threat into five simple categories? How can citizens of any country come to their own terms with the threat of terrorism? What do those categories mean for my daily life? What does it mean to talk about a Homeland? What popular, historical, or political substructures might offer insight, or challenge? Terreo is a digital art commentary on the Homeland Security Advisory System. It is a Windows application that runs in the system tray of the Windows task bar, along with the other gauges and utilities provided by the system. When an Internet connection is present, Terreo uses Web Services to update itself with live data from both the Department of Homeland Security and Amazon.com. Terreo then simultaneously displays both the current terror alert level and a book recommendation, including title, author, price, and a jacket image if available. Terreo deploys several strategies to comment on the Security Advisory System and the notion of Homeland Security in general. The Security Advisory System and the Department of Homeland Security are outward-facing systems. They purport to help Americans grapple with an external threat through strategies of protection, concealment, and confinement. But the system and the department do little to turn our attention inward, asking Americans to meditate on what it means to feel peril, how international politics (including US policies) relate to the threat of terrorism, and what individuals can do to consider their own role within this threat.Cultural critic and philosopher Slavoj Zizek argues that the symbolic value of the attack on the World Trade Center rests on the fact that the towers represented the ""center of virtual capitalism."" ""It is the awareness,"" says Zizek, ""that we live in an insulated artificial universe which regulates the notion that some ominous agent is threatening us all the time with total destruction"" (from an early version of ""Welcome to the Desert of the Real"" available on The Symptom; see sidebar for the book edition). Terreo attempts to poke a hole through this wall. Terreo's juxtaposition of terror alert levels and consumer products creates a kind of discourse absent from the Security Advisory System itself: that of meaningful, introspective engagement with the material world. Terreo presents the two cultural products in a commercial metaphor of personalization (Your terror alert level, Your book recommendation), individuating the system in a way that the US Government has been unable to do. The Security Advisory System is an entirely extrospective tool; it only offers a one-way view of the world. This perception seats terrorism and the fight against it from the sole vantage point of a stable and unblemished Homeland. It assumes that Americans can remain inside a safe room, gazing through a hermetically sealed window at the horrors of a harsh world outside. But in fact, we now all find ourselves in that harsh world, together. Terreo offers itself as an introspective tool, a mirror that allows users to question that vantage point by challenging themselves to order it in new ways. ",3/1/03 0:00,http://www.terreo.com,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,Date created: 2003-03-01,3/1/03 0:00,,,"A New Kind of Science, Afghanistan, Al Qaeda, and Requiem for the Towers, archive, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, Conceptual, Database, Documentary, Donald Rumsfeld, download, email, Escher, Generative, George W Bush, globalization, G√∂del, HTML, Internet, Linked: The New Science of Networks, M.C.

It is evident that the current war programmed against Iraq enters within a definition of corporate imperialism: thus protest against the war is part of the ""Over My Dead Body"" project's agenda.People are invited to participate, and are represented symbolically in the demonstration by their name, place of residence, and if they so wish, photo, and virtual placard.

I built a proto-type, enlisted a handful of artists, and in November of 1999 launched SocialArt.com.  Social Art was, at best, a great portfolio.  Without mechanisms in place to generate new content and keep the site fresh, or people to promote the site, the appeal of Social Art faded.  The energy required to maintain a place for artists to display their work was immense, and so the idea for Social Art began to seem pointless.By September of 2002, I had spent two years learning how to program computers in order to further my understanding of Internet technologies.

For me, writing a Hyperdrama was about proving to the performing arts world that working with new technology wasn't just scientific, and therefore diametrically opposed to artistic creativity, but that it was a great way of pushing artistic boundaries. My emerging interest in the internet as a platform for artistic performance grew out of wanting to reflect my lifestyle and the technology in it with my art. My contemporaries and I were growing up with technology integrated in our lives, and I felt that new technology should be integrated into art, if art was still to reflect upon, respond to, and challenge community, society, personality and culture. So writing a play that worked when you read it on the internet as it did in live performance was the beginning of my work exploring this area.A hyperdrama is a play that is written in hypertext, that is performed as a promenade and that is realised on multiple levels. Scenes happen simultaneously throughout a performance space. In this hyperdrama, there are five different locations where the action takes place. The scripts for the different locations are divided into levels which represent the time span of the piece (about 45 minutes real time). All the characters and locations in this hyperdrama are of equal importance. As a reader, you could follow the path of one character through the play by clicking on their hypertext links; read all the separate scripts in a linear fashion; or explore the hyperdrama more randomly by swapping between rooms via the hotlinks. ",2/19/04 13:31,http://www.hannahrudman.com,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: Drama, Play, Online play textDate created: 1997",2/19/04 13:31,,,"Billy Smart, digital, Event, Hannah Rudman, HTML, Internet, Narrative, performance, Text, The Benefactor"31924,The Birds,dylan,davis,dylan davis,"InspirationThe inspiration came from waiting for the tram at the bottom of Elizabeth St. As I looked up at all the birds on the cables, they sat in set of patterns that lent itself to a musical sequence.ConceptThe concept of this sound toy is to use the four birds as notes in a musical sequence. Each bird represents a note in a bar of music. The two rows of birds allow for two types of sounds, one long and the other short.Version 1.0This version has two different states for each bird, off and on, clicking on the bird accesses these states. If the bird is in the on position the bird will play a note and trigger an animation as it plays the note. There is a moving ray of light in the sky to show the user where in the bar they are up to.OngoingThe soundtoy functions, as it should. I would like to animate the birds so when they were in the off position for more than 5 seconds they would fly away, and if the user clicked on an empty spot on the cable a bird would fly in and land. The ability to add many birds to each cable would mean the sound handling would need to be moved over to the beatnik xtra which allows up to 64 channels of audio, rather than the current limitation of 8 channels.Extending the ConceptA webcam could be installed at Elizabeth St, which pointed at these cables, the timeline would work the same way and if a bird were on the cables a sound would be played.

The Book after the Book (1999/2000) is a hypertextual and visual essay about cyberliterature, where criticism and web art melts into the context of the net_reading/writing_condition. Its main focus is non-linear narratives, which reconfigure the literature/book relationship starting from the very notion of volume. Works that provide programming language a textual appraisal, creations that resort to videographic procedures in literary construction and play on the passivity and participation of the reader. Short animations intercept the reading of other artists works playing with the textual condition of the on line image and, at the same time, with the imagetic condition of the screen text. They are all images that perform texts and face the strange passage imposed by the net. Deep down, on the back of the page, at the source, a situation is defined: the Internet is no more than a big text. On the front, at the screen, text reveals itself as image.That strangeness introduces aesthetic dimensions that go beyond the technical horizon of multimedia. It can be writing one more line in the History of the Book. The History of Literature after the book. A History that, from the point of view of material culture has run on very stable grounds since Renaissance. It is as surprising as undeniable. From the Classic Era to present days, the book, as an object, has changed very little.This stability is, at least, intriguing, in view of the symbolic value attributed to the disposable product by the cultural industry. It invites the thought that Literary History is also the history of reading and of the supports where the interaction between reader and text takes place. They are more than content receptacles. These supports are reading contexts where significations are built.A gesture repertoire, a tactile game between hand and paper (or mouse), a constellation of objects and vision instruments defines the position of reading in this world. Unstable positions, no doubt. Here is Borges' enigmatic Book of Sand . A book in which it is impossible to return to the page which has been read. The Book of Books. The book of reading.The Book after the Book central axle is a bookshelf whose shelves, which accommodate cyberliterature and artworks, are cut off by reading intervals. They are ""empty pages "", fading from gray to white, that hinder the return from the shelf to the bookshelf, using the browser back button. It is necessary to appeal to the web site tool bar in order to move between its books of sand and zones of friction.Not only each turn back implies in a new reading itinerary, but any selection means to run the risk to change the path, to lose the starting point and to redirect the reading route. The advance toward a selected work makes the reader exit The Book after the Book web site. The bookshelf functions now as node of a network, a set of revolving shelves, a new reading machine. After all, remembering again Borges, is there any place better than a library to lose a book?Nevertheless, one is not after the novelty of cyberculture, nor striving to reinforce the now tedious discourse of the Internet's redeeming potential as a computer web able to candidly unite all humanity into a global village. This wouldn't be more than a chapter in the spectacular history being successfully elaborated in the last ten years by the computer and software industry. This narrative confers to the selfsame industry the power and the mission to inaugurate a new era. The subject here is not the no-book, but the book after the book, the computer not as a new art support, but as a new reading and writing machine: an interface.",9/10/01 15:59,http://www.desvirtual.com/giselle,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/2065/thebook/,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: cyberliterature, hypernarrativeDate cloned: 2013-03-01",9/10/01 15:59,,,"Animation, Conceptual, desvirtual.com, DHTML, digital, Giselle Beiguelman, HTML, interface, Internet, Java, Javascript, language, netart, publish, Text, VITAE Foundation, ZKM"2050,The Book of Days,P,Hintsanen,phintsanen,"'The Book of Days' asks questions about time and origin, and aboutliving now in this time.

Media artist Nora Farrell and I created it.¬†EMF:  And the long answer?Duckworth: The longer answer involves a description of the whole Cathedral Project, and its three primary components-the website itself, which features a variety of interactive musical, artistic, and text-based experiences, all focused on 5 mystical moments in time; the PitchWeb, which is one of the virtual instruments designed for the site to allow listeners to play together online; and The Cathedral Band, a group of improvising musicians that gives periodic live performances from venues around the world, during which our global PitchWeb players frequently sit in.EMF:  How did you think of this project?  When did it begin?Duckworth:  Nora and I had our first talks about the project in Amsterdam in March 1996, talking about the Internet and what we might be able to do with it artistically.  When we came back to New York we began working on Cathedral immediately, but it didn't actually go online until June 10, 1997.EMF:  You‚Äôre working in such a new medium on the Web, what‚Äôs the artistic concept of Cathedral and how do you express it online?Duckworth:  The Web presented me with a unique way to experiment with the concept of asynchronous time, something I‚Äôd long been interested in exploring.  There are, after all, only a few ways that we can escape the limitations of time.  Experiencing art, particularly online, is one of these ways.  And with Cathedral, because there is no fixed beginning, middle or end, there is less of an emphasis on location and less of a need for everyone to coexist in the same physical space.  As Cathedral slowly unfolds, there are, all along the way, a myriad of points in which players can influence the outcome, and events are allowed to inform other events as the piece continues to grow.",6/10/97 0:00,http://cathedral.monroestreet.com,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,Date created: 1997-06-10,6/10/97 0:00,,,"Animation, audio, Collaborative, Database, DHTML, email, Flash, Generative, HTML, interact, Internet, Java, Javascript, MP3, Narrative, netart, network, Participatory, performance, QuickTime, RealPlayer, Shockwave, social space, software"2295,The Central City {Net Art } edition,stanza,,STANZA,"This project has also been exhibited at.museo tamayo arte contempor√°neo 2002 + fluxusonline 2002 + cosign germany 2002 + fcmm montreal 2002 + physical vs. logical space , austrailia + cinemania(c) croatia 2002 + arte digital cuba 2002 + isea japan 2002 + Garage Festival Germany 2002 + Senef korea 2002 + nimes 2002 + emaf 2002 + siggraph usa 2002 + soundtoys 2002 + cybersonica 2002 + Fused 2002 + Sao Paulo Bienale 2002 + Zeppelin Barcelona 2002 + Net.art in 4L Istanbul 2002 + Immedia 2002 usa + Net-working 2001 + Soeul Net art 2001 + Generative Art 4th GA2001 + A Fair Place Turkey.2001 + McLean Project Casting a Net USA 2001 + Art Image Graz 2001 + Video Lisboa Lisbon 2001 + Impakt Utrecht 2001 + Medi@terra Greece 2001 + Cynet 2001 Dresden + E.I.I.Festival edinburgh 2001 + Garage Festival Germany 2001 + Urban Myths.Israel 2001 Independent Newspaper best site of the week 2001 + DLUX 2001 Austrailia + Moscow International Festival 2001 + Sonar 2001 + net-z-lab 2001 + Vdor21/Break21 2001 + Thaw 2001 + arco 2001 + Transmediale 2001 + Architettura in Video 2000 + Netart 2000 + Independent Newspaper best site of the week 2000 + Macromedia's UCON 1999 + BIMA shortlist UK 1999 + emaf 1999 + Seafair 1998 +THE CENTRAL CITY AND INNER CITYINTRODUCTION.The idea is to go deeper into analogies for the organic identity of the city. The micro city becomes an organic networks of grids and diagrams.The form and content of this work is a visual world of the city and its structure. Networks of information technology are contrasted with organic networks and city networks. The project fuses the sounds of specific places.The sounds of language impose a rhythm that the visual narrative can interact with. ‚ÄòThe central city ‚Äò, is an audio visual, interactive, internet art, experience. The central city consists of text pieces, embedded sounds, all made for the internet. The city becomes an organic network of grids and diagrams, juxtaposing urban sights and sounds.I wanted to develop analogies for the organic identity of the city as an urban community and make links with electronic networks and virtual communities. This organic interplay is contrasted with man made structures, as well as patterns and forms of urban design. The online spaces are for dreaming, thinking, meditating and transience. The form and content of this work is a visual world of the city and its structure. A visual labyrinth, a maze of circumstance. The city itself is always changing; it is always in flux. Each aspect of city life seems to demonstrate specific characteristics, which can be developed into individual parts of the labyrinth, making up the images that will be used. A city experience consists of small unit blocks and cells which inter-relate and lock together to form the composite city identity. The city has moved from metropolis to megalopolis to the ecumenopolis. The city is everywhere, with lifeless design spreading upwards and forming a conundrum of physical objects in space. A city form is a conundrum of physical objects in space. Cities become ""insect colonies"", spreading upwards with giant towers looming over vacant lots, and empty spaces.TOWARDS THE MATRIX. GRID CITYMy artistic intervention tries to look at fragments of our experience of cities, that make up the whole city. The central city, is a place which appears out of control, but which we try to control through design. The city as grids, and repetition, can appear sublime or it can confuse and appear prison like. Giant cities paint a gloomy picture, of mass urban sprawl; the megalopolis is spreading upwards and everywhere to house a population of which 70 - 80% now lives in cites worldwide.These online works represent spaces, they are idealised spaces. I don‚Äôt see ‚Äòthe central city‚Äô, as a simulation. In fact, I am not aiming or particularly interested in simulation. I view the final evolution of the project as a experience, an online internet experience, which can be viewed inside the white cube of the box which is a computer. The framework, the grid, that contains this work is the computer and the internet. Images of maps redrawing and reprocessing themselves. This allows the city a perpetual evolution, no single similar path need be followed.THE CITY AS SOUNDI am interested in the sounds of specific places, and how the sounds reflect this identity and re-impose characteristics back onto the location or environment. Cities all have specific identities, and found sound can give us clues to the people that inhabit these spaces, as well as provoking us and stimulating our senses in a musical way. The sounds of language impose a rhythm that the visual narrative can interact with. The intention within newer sections of the central city, is to create an audio visual experience that evokes place, both as literal description but also developed musical composition. These are the ideas that are informing my new ‚Äòsoundmaps‚Äô series , and ‚Äòsoundcity‚Äô. The city codes itself up into a growing patterns, based on algorithmic patterns. The digital city experience. This is a playfulness not far or dissociated from the playfulness of the situationist critique. And like the situationists, they also wanted to build cities.My initial response in the central city project for example was to deconstruct a language of the urban and city environment, and then to build it back up as an art image to try to constitute both a new form and new meaning. By placing oneself in the middle of this particular structure, the meaning or the aesthetic experience is only encountered when you decide to move from any one place to the next. I use these small fragments as rhythms, to interact with the next part, and evolve into something new. These parts are cells, or parts of a whole that generate itself. The nature of the sounds and noise of cities varies in tone and language. A background rhythm can come into the foreground. It mixes itself, and evolves. The city is its own music, constantly evolving, a beautiful composition of squeaks, clanks, and pulses. We are familiar but distracted as it bombards our conscious slipstream. Yet the sounds evolve, generate, move, die, fade and shift. The sounds of the city are out there all the time, there is no silence, the code does not stop. The children, the trains, the drills, the animals, the micro sounds, the sounds of our bodies, the sounds of the street, the insides of our souls. Familiar forms, identities and sounds are common to all cities, and yet each have special forms that separate and identity particular places and spaces.All the sounds are recorded from mini -disc and originally sourced they are then fed into the central city. The sounds files work in differing way, some are looped, some are mixed, and some are generative. There is even a jukebox section, where sounds stream down off the juke box from the server and you can re-enact you own karaoke at home, by reciting the words over the top of the industrial city soundtrack.

The video work is based on analogue signal, compressions, glitches and feedback artifacts in sound and video. For this part of the 30 minutes video, I used a NES, some image bending and a broken photo camera (CCD chip is loose) && for the sound I used a cracklebox, feedback, Eurosignal and a couple of DV-compressed videobends. In ""The Collapse of PAL"" (Eulogy, Obsequies and Requiem for the planes of blue phosphor), the Angel of History (as described by Walter Benjamin) reflects on the PAL signal and its termination. This death sentence, although executed in silence, was a brutally violent act that left PAL disregarded and obsolete. While it might be argued that the PAL signal is dead, it still exists as a trace left upon the new, ‚Äòbetter‚Äô digital technologies. PAL can, even though the technology is terminated, be found here as a historical form that newer technologies build upon, in- herit or have appropriated from. Besides this, the Angel also realizes that the new DVB signal that has been chosen over PAL is different, but at the same time also inherently flawed as PAL.‚îÄ‚ñà‚ñà‚îÄ‚ñÄ‚îÄ‚ñå‚ñà",5/28/12 12:40,https://vimeo.com/12199201,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,,5/1/10 0:00,,,"PAL, signal, broadcast, glitch, compression, Walter Benjamin, memory, Angel of History, Narrative, video, media archeology, Nintendo"35257,The Color Channel,Steven,Read,Steve OR Steven Read,"In a recent gallery exhibition, I explored the past, present, and future of communication and broadcasting systems. Today, corporate media networks are desperately clinching to their long-held control of information and bandwidth, lately acting as if nothing has changed during the past decades of communication and information revolutions. They will fight vigorously to hold on to this lopsided power structure, even as individuals and small groups begin to form channels of their own...Each of the 20 TV sets in the gallery were tuned to a standard UHF television channel. I 'hijacked' a few corporate-owned airwave frequencies (such as FOX and UPN) and overwrote their content with my own. This technology presented the viewer with great and unpredictable variations of imagery. For one, the communication noise resulting from the transmission gives my digital content a new and different facture. Viewers physically present in the gallery also interact with the broadcast and their bodily presence affects the reception and visualization of the art. At other times, both corporate-controlled and artist-controlled signals would actually compete for the channel, causing the TV to synthesize them together into new images. In addition, the various retro and contemporary platforms of television/antennae hardware realized the broadcasted images uniquely, as if they too were the spectators.For my new TV channels I chose to broadcast custom-software generated videos which resemble television test patterns and modernist paintings, in motion. These pattern-paintings are shown for varied lengths of time, achieving a balance somewhere between beautiful-signal and mindless-noise.",6/3/05 0:00,http://www.stevenread.com/art/colorchannel/,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,Date created: 2005-06-03,6/3/05 0:00,,,"broadcast, commercialization, Conceptual, corporate, digital, exhibition, Formalist, Generative, installation, Java, Readymade, software, space, technophobia, television, video"29175,The Concise Model of the Universe,Paul,Annear,The Paul Annears,"XXOS Group is the umbrella organisation that finances the variousprojects of The Paul Annears.

The work also serves to inquire if recent non-symbolic approaches to AI are more appropriate in the making of art and perhaps in the modeling of intelligence. It, furthermore, brings our attention to the spatio-temporal specificity of sound, exploring some of the co-determining interplay between sound and architecture.

The project is an exploration of human identity as affected by the forces of globalization and makes full use of all the tools of the modern economy - distributed work across several time zones, outsourcing to take advantages of cost disparities, an open source model that allows input from contributors, and of course the internet itself as a medium of display and exchange. Mike travels the world photographing in each city the first one hundred people he can convince to take part in his project. He then combines the faces to create one new male and female individual, which for him is a distilled representation of that place at a future moment in time. On a personal level it is one artist‚Äôs search for identity and belonging and the relationship of self to the larger world.  On a deeper level it as an exploration of the systems behind globalization and how these systems might influence the future make-up of each individual locus. Having grown up in apartheid-era South Africa, educated on four continents and currently living in Istanbul, itself a ‚Äúschizophrenic city‚Äù sited on two continents looking east and west as well as north and south, it is understandable that these issues arising from globalization would form the central thesis of his work. The source code, which documents the photoshoot, selection and morphing process is open for inspection and change by all involved.  As a result the project has now taken on a life of its own, like a computer code or virus, and at present there are people in Colombia, Japan, Germany and Holland working on the project independently of Mike.  Mike‚Äôs journey of discovery began a few years ago, on a trip to London. ‚ÄúSitting on the underground train, I was intrigued by the sheer diversity of the place - Somalis, Indians, Americans, Zimbabweans, Scandinavians and a hundred other nationalities vying for their place in the metropolis. I thought ‚Äúwhat is this place, what is a Londoner?‚Äù  A few weeks later I was in Istanbul and looking at the relative uniformity of the population I realized I was looking at the future of London. A thousand years ago Istanbul was the capital of the remnants of the Roman Empire - home to an astonishing variety of peoples from Greece, Rome, central Asia, Arabia and the Russia.  Yet now this diversity had settled down to something vaguely homogenous - almost everyone dark haired, brown-eyed and with light brown skin. And I thought if one could merge all the people in a place like London one would be looking at the future of that place - one would have some notion of what a Londoner is or will become.‚ÄùTaking as his reference point the early work of Francis Galton and more recent works by Gerhard Lang and Nancy Burson, which explore issues of identity through a layering photographic technique, Mike has established a systematic almost census-like approach to this theme.  Asking the question ‚ÄúWhat does a New Yorker, a Londoner, a Parisian look like?‚Äù he attempts to find an answer by photographing one hundred people he stops at random on the street and then combining those faces to create a new individual - someone that doesn‚Äôt exist right now but someone it seems quite real - almost familiar.The Face of Tomorrow is intensely site-specific as we meet individuals from different locales around the globe and it is also extremely broad in its scope as it attempts to distil these individuals into one face that somehow captures the ‚Äúlook‚Äù of a city or place.  The work is thus at the same time a document of a place at a moment in time and also an extrapolation of that place towards some utopian future where all differences of race or individuality are forgotten. It is this juxtaposition between the real and the unreal, between the foreign and the familiar, between the ordinary and the extraordinary and between the photographic and the painterly that allows the work to resonate beyond its immediate spatial and temporal references.  It allows connections to be made despite these limitations as we see that different places around the world can sometimes produce dramatically similar results.  These disjunctions allow viewers to question their own notion of self and identity and to perhaps come away challenged on one level and appreciative of an underlying connectedness between all humanity on another.",8/8/04 0:00,http://www.faceoftomorrow.com,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: open source, democracyDate created: 2004-08-08",8/8/04 0:00,,,"Ankara, archive, Beirut, Bogota, buenos aires, Cape Town, Conceptual, contextual, Damascus, Documentary, Flash, futurism, globalization, HTML, identity, information map, installation, Internet, Istanbul, Lima, Lisbon, London, Melbourne, memory, Mike Mike, New York, Pamplona, Participatory, posthuman, Quito, Rio de Janeiro, Santiago, Sao Paulo, sydney, utopia, Virtual, Visual"37904,The Feather Box,,,Sera Mac,"The Feather Box is a summary of delicate yet resilient impressions I had obtained during a time when I lived in Malaysia.

Players move forward through a linear narrative only by shooting, fighting, catching or colliding with a character.Instead of winning a point, a player is rewarded with a piece of the narrative.

Each branch is a choice, path, situation, experience, emotion, you choose to take or feel in your life. In life we are only going forward. And so the branches you choose will only take you forward.I see us as souls, which carry our body, our vehicle, through life, plunging it into feeling and sensing life.Throughout this, I have found joy in misery and ultimate misery in joy. Understanding that emotions coexist and survive because of each other is a way of understanding the present.Being present in time is rarely a conscious state. But when you do experience being present in the moment, all falls into place. In it‚Äôs own way, in a way words will never express, it all makes sense. So through visuals, I have tried to express the feeling of being present, and engaging with that feeling fully, without judging the situation.To me, this is my explanation of our Journey. Maybe tomorrow I will have another explanation.

The website's main focus falls on a single character who goes by the name of Orion17.  Orion is a minimalist composer who is fascinated to the point of obsession with the patterns and logic that frame reality.  ""I would leave all this in a moment if I could be the marrow, the idea, the virus, the entity whose self is not corporeal,"" he explains.  When a powerful vision shows him the way to achieve his dream of uniting with the world of abstraction, Orion makes the leap and joins a small team of researchers at the newly-founded Institute for Investigation into the Mind of Marrow.  There, he experiences first-hand both the euphoria and the frustration that comes from living life as a ""marrow monkey.""Most Shockwave applications on the Web at the time the piece was created were either linear animation pieces or novelty games, and relatively few developers had tried to create truly dynamic pieces that responded in detailed, meaningful ways to user input. This was one of the main objectives of the site: to begin to show how a highly dynamic, abstract interface can play a significant role in communicating setting and narrative to users.  Representational graphics were deliberately avoided in an attempt to strip down the language of interactivity to archetypal levels.  Music, on the other hand, was used extensively to contrast with the spare visual language.The site consists of nine scenes, each of which functions much like an aria in an opera, a ""frozen moment"" during which a character's current situation and concerns can be revealed in detail.  Many scenes require active participation on the part of the user in constructing or exploring the meaning being conveyed.  Users are encouraged to make use of the interface for these scenes to enact the relationships between the ideas, events and characters being presented as part of the narrative.  The visceral and dynamic nature of the interactions help to make these relationships tactile and interesting for users, allowing them to experience Orion17's obsessions from the inside out.",1/27/98 0:00,http://www.marrowmonkey.com/lair,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: dynamicDate created: 1998-01-27",1/27/98 0:00,,,"Abstract, Animation, audio, Conceptual, design, Erik Loyer, Formalist, Generative, HTML, interact, interface, language, memory, Participatory, Shockwave, Visual"3199,the land project,dlsan,,dlsan ,"The Land Project is an open space for linking artworks about concepts of your land, country or nation.

The Machine Manifesto is composed of a series of mechanical musical instruments or automatons, and directed by a conductor of orchestra. These instruments, programmed to perform independent tasks, follow by themselves the commands sent by the conductor via image recognition software.In its integrity, this work reflects the existing asymmetry in human-machine relationship (conductor-instruments), providing a critical look on the privileged position of machines in our society. The Machine Manifesto explores the relation between man and machine; between the ""natural"" world and the ""mechanical"" world; between the physical, real and biological, and the technological, virtual and digital. Such oppositions are a great source of conflict in western societies,which affirm their conquest of modernity through their domination of the technological paradigm. By means of this project we intend to raise a socio-cultural debate on what is real and what it is simulated, what is human intelligence and what is artificial intelligence. The creation of automatons for this project echoes the history of the development of the machine in its more ingenious aspects. The automatons have been present in the three essential phases of the history of technology: the mechanics, the machine, and the electronics. The automaton is the result of the most positivist thought and true hope on technology, it is the ultimate challenge between the divine and the human.

You are invited to experience culture on a fascinating and promising new site. Millions of miles away the red planet now lies within your reach - in an entirely new way. Since the early days the MARS PATENT committee has been working hard to find a discriminating place for your desires which allows a new sight on Earth: The MARS PATENT offers its MARS EXHIBITION SITE (MES) to you as a free experimental area and invites every thing which does not fit entirely on Earth but tends towards the MES. A thing? A real thing? Could be your idea, your object, your work, your question, your protest, your project, your desire. Mars - still untouched by human hands - is a dry, cold and poisonous place and often experienced to be of terrific beauty. The Mars Exhibition Site (MES) is located near the equator in the north of a lowland area named Elysium Planitia. MES is a floating area. Its slightly changing form is a strung-out rectangle. Think of an area of approximately 3148 square kilometers offering a wide range of altitudes within a rocky landscape filled with incredibly shaped lava masses - exposed to storms and temperatures varying rapidly between -127 ¬∞C and +15 ¬∞C. The MARS PATENT is a place for art and theory and sensible to its various concepts. With MARS PATENT's HRM\_1.0n (High Reality Machine) we offer cutting edge technologies for installing sculptures, Internet relay chats, kinetic objects, art-and media theories, science fiction literature, telepresence systems, videos, sound installations, manifestos, web-art etc. by teleportation. This machine will become a potent device in your hands to place your things on the MES.The main feature of the HRM\_1.0n is the signal transmission with the ‚Äòsender‚Äô located on Earth and the ‚Äòreceiver‚Äô located on Mars. The teleportation by the HRM\_1.0n signifies an irreversible transfer from Earth to Mars. No matter treated by the HRM\_1.0n will remain undamaged - from slight atomic disturbances to even more destructive effects.

The ultimate ""Judgement of Taste"" in the form of a marketing survey. In a way it was a traditional idea, because a faith in numbers is fundamental to people, starting with Plato's idea of a world which is based on numbers. In ancient Greece, when sculptors wanted to create an ideal human body they measured the most beautiful men and women and then made an average measurement, and that's how they described the ideal of beauty and how the most beautiful sculpture was created. In a way, this is the same thing; in principle, it's nothing new. It's interesting: we believe in numbers, and numbers never lie. Numbers are innocent. It's absolutely true data. It doesn't say anything about personalities, but it says something more about ideals, and about how this world functions. That's really the truth, as much as we can get to the truth.

At the web visitors' command, the Recycler grabs images from live webcams around the world and performs real-time ""Cultural Recycling"" on them to create new ""objects of web art."" The project parodies the web's obsession with images and with webcams as tools not only for voyeurism and surveillance, but for exhibitionism and for distribution of celebrity. The Recycler appointed itself the Andy Warhol of the web, performing the obligatory cultural recycling on the web's newfound webcam celebrities - presumably legitimizing them as digital stars. It also had some fun with the faux multi-culturalism of the 1996 web, a time when cultures of the world were uniting themselves through animated gifs, banners, and of course webcams.After creating recycled images, visitors could choose to exhibit them in the Multi-Cultural Recycler gallery. The gallery functioned as a critique of what was at the time (1996/7) a  contentious subject: galleries and museums attempting to exhibit ""objectless"" net art projects.  Once posted in the gallery, a visitor's recycled image could be further recycled by future visitors - thus increasing its celebrity/art object status. But, as virtual art objects, images in the Recycler Gallery receive only limited immortality. After rotating through the Recycler Gallery's six display positions, the artwork's file on the server's disk is overwritten by a younger art object.The Recycler has received a number of awards and appeared in venues including ISEA, New York Digital Salon, Prix Ars Electronica, Werkleitz Biennale, pARTS Gallery, USA Today, Netscape and Yahoo. It was a Webby Award nominee in 1999, and has been continuing to exhibit up til the present day.",3/14/02 17:38,http://recycler.plagiarist.org,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: humor, parody, webcam, exhibitionism, voyeurism, software repurposingComments from user: Technologies could use an ""other"" box.Recycler is made of shell scripts and movie compositing software (Eddie), e.g. Date created: 1996",3/14/02 17:38,,,"Amy Alexander, Andy Warhol, Anti-art, art world, collider, Conceptual, CyberSpace, Eddie Compositor, exhibition, Generative, HTML, Internet, network, Perl, Readymade, Recycler Gallery, Softimage, software, surveillance, television, Visual"47028,The Natural History of Alamogordo,,,Bob Cotton,"These images are randomly generated by a software collage machine selecting from a database of images that includes my own prints, drawings, paintings and source materials collected by me over the last twenty years.

Introduction to The Thiefby Lynne CookeWith his systematization of a one-point perspectival system for illusionistic representation, Leon Battista Alberti offered painters a method of constructing a space that was coherent and cohesive when viewed from a single position: painting thus came to simulate a window onto a world beyond, a fictional yet mimetically convincing milieu. For the Belgian-born artist Francis Al√øs, the momentous influence of Alberti's codification on subsequent methods of visual representation finds a telling contemporary analogue in the spatial tenets embodied in today's ubiquitous electronic technologies. Arguably, Windows 95 may embody and consequently canonize for virtual space much of the revolutionary potential that Alberti's model did for those illusory worlds first limned in the early Renaissance. Al√øs took this hypothesis as his starting point when invited to make a website project at Dia. For this, his first engagement with the medium of the internet, he has proposed a screen saver, accompanied by an website component that expounds his thesis. Originally devised to prevent the transparency of the computer screen from being blemished by static pixels burning into its surface, the screen saver has become almost anachronistic, a decorative mask, a prelude to entry into the electronic matrix proper. The Thief presents a black field in which an obliquely angled window gradually is revealed, giving on to pure light. Emerging slowly from the penumbrous foreground recesses, the shadow of a figure approaches the window and nimbly clambers through. Some ambiguity surrounds this exit, however, for the final moments in this sequence can also be read in reverse so that the figure seems to fall forward, dropping out of sight into the uncharted nearer depths. Shot in film then manipulated for the computer screen, this episode carries within cinematic echoes, which are reinforced by the introduction of a filmstrip as the key to eliciting the texts that amplify Al√øs's thesis within the web component of his artwork. This confirms, retrospectively, the hint that the white frame of the isolated window, prior to the appearance of the figure, should also be read as a movie screen, as a projection in short. Looping at short intervals, the brief action mimics those compulsive, scatter-shot forays into new terrain that have come to characterize browsing in this boundless, immaterial realm. Trained as an architect, Al√øs turned to a visual arts based practice in the early 1990s as a more immediate, direct, and effective way of exploring issues related to urbanization, to the ordering and signification of urban space and to the semiotics of its use. As in his previous professional undertakings, he continues to prefer to work collaboratively, or when this is not appropriate, to operate within a public arena. For some of his best known works, he initiates a design, which is copied and reworked by a team of trained sign painters in Mexico City, where Al√øs currently lives. Other projects, presented as video projections, have involved making journeys through the city with some appendage or prosthesis conditioning his passage, as he tracks or inscribes a provisional cartography onto its generic forms. When conceiving this piece for Dia, he not only drew on specialists for technical assistance but sought through visual and verbal quotation to engage once more with multiple, related voices and viewpoints. -Lynne CookeThis project was commissioned by the Dia Center for the Arts with support from the New York State Council for the Arts.

This piece is expressing a sense of prisony and oppression, from which a first stage of hysteria appears identified with the worms crossing the room.The theme of hysteria manifests more directly in the struggle of the second section: ""Le Formiche"", in which a succession of images of shaking hair, falling flowers, black paint on canvas, and frenetic body movements inhabit the screen. The third part of the trilogy, ""Lo Specchio"", revolves around the theme of death and purification in a settings very similar to the first piece ""La Torre"", just this time the atmosphere in the room with the chequered floor ha changed, because the struggle and the tension are now gone.

Russian born artist Galina Manikova, who has lived in Norway since 1986, is responsible for the idea and took the initiative for this project, which is supported by Norwegian Cultural Fond. www.wailingwall.no is a place, where the visitors can put their own notes in the Wailing Wall or find, open, read and comment on the notes, left by other visitors. These notes do not have to be complains, they may show pictures, provoke discussions or express hopes and wishes. Aside from that public related part, the website hides a lot of small visual or musical elements and experiences that the visitors to this site can trace and play with. This project offers also a lot of links to other relevant and entertaining websites. One can get to some deeper layers and hidden sides only by participating actively. When one puts own new notes into the wall, one gets further to some new layers and discovers some new sides within this project, which continuously gets changed and updated. The main subject of www.wailingwall.no is walls, why they are build and how they influence the mankind. This site allows ordinary people to express their opinions on the subject uncensored. Right now have many people already sent a lot of notes containing different views on the Lebanese war, the conflict in the Middle East and the subject of terrorism, which shows how relevant and up to date this project can become.Webart duo Hege Vadstein and Paul Brady have made programming and visual design of the site in collaboration with Galina Manikova, while the British composer Kyan Laslett O`Brian created the music. Photograph of the wall is by David Dector, who lives in Jerusalem. This project is a result of a long-term work on the subject of walls, why they get built and how they influence humanity. Walls could be a good thing that symbolizes protection, security, safety and privacy. Walls could also be a bad thing that stands for segregation, isolation, imprisonment or persecution.This esoteric wailing wall in cyber space has a reference to different cultural and religious practices like a Buddhist tree of wishes or Wailing Wall in Jerusalem, where the visitors can place their complains, wishes, pictures and regrets. Other people can see and read them and make comments.Aside from this interactive part this virtual wall hides a lot of links to different other relevant sites that can be informative or entertaining. I also use this wall to publish documentation in form of photographs and notes that I am collecting from series of installations that started in Turkey and China in 2006. I am continuously scanning and putting out the notes in different languages that have been placed physically in the ‚Äùwalls of wishes‚Äù at different locations around the world.My wailing wall is hiding several deeper layers that can be accessed only by making a direct contribution to the project, which is leading one to the destiny wheel. Each time one makes a new contribution one gets a new chance to read about own destiny for that moment in form of a short story visualizing an event that can be interpreted in many different ways.This project is allowing everyone to express a meaning or publish a picture. The longer one stays there, the more new features one discovers. This project is changing continuously and is often reflecting on different events in different countries and politics. Conflict in the Middle East, Iraq war and acts of terror were commented from different points of view.Hege Vadstein and Paul Brady stand for programming and visual forming of this site in cooperation with Galina Manikova, while British composer Kyan Laslett O`Brian has created the music.

The microbe is powered by a search engine (at this stage we have integrated Google, Altavista and Lycos). [3] In physical space, the interactive stage serves as a screen for a projector that beams from its top. The Microbe is projected upon the user and follows his movements. The search string is projected on the floor right after being submitted. [4] Stepping on text on the floor with the microbe sends the text to the microbe's search engine and returns the title of the first search result. The new text replaces the old ones and become new triggers for a search. The composition creates a conversation between users using search engines combined with a live interactive music score. [5] The work will be available online (controlled by the users mouse&keyboard) constantly like any other net art work but will reach it's full potential in the form of realspace installation that interacts both online users, activating their microbes through the use of the mouse, and physical participants, moving their microbes by the movement of their bodies. [see online interactive demo for a better grasp of the composition] The project deals with issues within the discourse of net-ethics, but tries to use the artistic method to create an experience which is theoretically challenging on one hand and pure fun on the other.

Primo Levi's The Monkey's Wrench, published in Italian in 1978, is a fictional collection of tales told to a narrator by an itinerant steelworker, Tino Faussone. Faussone's sharply observed accounts of life on the job outline an idiosyncratic philosophy organized by profound individuality and a deeply contingent and physical relationship to the world. The stories reflect on both the meaning of work and the work of narrative.Knifeandfork's The Wrench recasts Levi's work into a mobile phone text-message exchange between participants and a contemporary Tino played by an artificially intelligent agent. Taking place over the course of a week, the dialogue, though reminiscent of an SMS-novel, is not entirely predetermined. Rather, Tino attempts to be convincingly human, and the real-time narrative intertwines the lives of the character and participant through the ubiquitous yet restrictive communication channel of text-messaging. Further, certain interests and events of the character's life are dynamically generated from real-world material via RSS/Atom content feeds. By animating Levi's original text, The Wrench challenges the division between the experience of a fiction and our performance of everyday life.The Wrench is technically realized with Knifeandfork's TXTML, free software for creating interactive SMS applications.

As theBot reads an excerpt from each page, its text animates across the screen, mimicking the flow of network packets. Meanwhile, theBot's voice reads the text aloud - layered and often repeating itself, an obsessive compulsive beat poet of the net. A listing of visited URLs begins to catalog along the side of the screen, incrementing with each URL visited - stanzas of URL poetry.

The taxi is also equipped with a GPS that feeds an onboard computer data such as speed and direction. This computer is running custom audio/video manipulation software and uses GPS data to make decisions about how the live video/audio feed is manipulated and seen by the passenger. The manipulations of the live feed is displayed on two LCD screens and heard through the cars stereo system. As the user tells the driver where to go the passenger becomes both performer and viewer as they experience a unique piece of art generated by their decisions.

Carpenter explores the formal and functional properties of RSS, using blogging, tagging and other Web 2.0 tools to mark-up and interlink essays and to insert additional meta-layers of commentary in order to play with, expose, expand upon, and subvert formal structures of writing, literature, and literary criticism.Over a four-month period Carpenter reads and re-reads the essays, parsing them into fragments, which she then annotates, marks-up, tags and posts. Fed into an RSS stream, the fragments are re-read, reordered, and reblogged in an iterative process of distribution that opens up new readings of the essays and reveals new interrelationships between them. The result of this process-based approach is be part blog, part archive - an online repository for the artifacts of re-reading and a stage for the performance of live archiving.Streams are both literally and metaphorically the central image of the work. Streams of consciousness, data, and rivers flow through the interface and through the texts. Through this process of re-reading and responding, this textual tributary feeds a larger stream while paying tribute to the original source.Slip into this text-fed stream at any time by subscribing to our RSS feed here: http://tributaries.thecapilanoreview.ca/feed/The final version of Tributaries & Text-fed Streams: A Feed-Reading of The Capilano Review will launch simultaneously on http://thecapilanoreview.ca and http://turbulence.org in May 2008.",1/1/08 0:00,http://tributaries.thecapilanoreview.ca/,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,,1/1/08 0:00,,,"archive, Artistic collaboration, blog, electronic literature, History, Internet, mark-up, poetics, remix, rss, The Capilano Review, turbulence.org"3138,trilogy,Lisa,Bloomfield,Lisa Bloomfield,"Trilogy is comprised of 3 image/text narratives whose themes are concerned with survival. Locale and characters are suggested by cropped fragments from mass media imagery as well as map fragments.  While the images may allude to time period by photographic style or content,their function (protagonist, action, location) is directed by the text.  Trilogy is a collaboration with Los Angeles fiction writers Rod Moore and Kathrine Haake, both of whom have allowed me to reconfigure their texts in in considering how narrative unfolds, how one interprets imagery, how language alters this interpretation and how the gaps between the two become an unspoken and influential voice as well.I have been working with language-image relationships and narrative sequence since a graduate student at California Institute of the Arts (1980), where I specialized in photographic image/text installations and bookworks. My work exists as prints (diptychs, installations, double-page spreads), book form, as well as in billboard and web site.My interest in digital technology stemmed initially from the ease with which text and image could be combined using the computer rather than through darkroom practice, as well as my need, as an instructor of photography to explore new modes intersecting photographic expression.  As a result of exploring digital manipulation I began to look at the intersection of language and image within the context of the web.

The actions we take, the pages we visit, and the objects we select are all ways of expressing and sharing our views and ideas. The troika interfaces makes this explicit by generating mappings of the database that is dependent on the activities of its users.The Troika interfaces display each object in the Rhizome database as one pixel. The object is accessed by clicking on the pixel. The pixel's color represents the keywords that are associated with the object and the people that have requested it in relation to a specified troika - a conceptual triad such as ""body, mind, spirit"". The color that represents the object is changed over time as a result of users making traces in the database. The users are marked with the color of the object they first select, and are leaving a trace of that color on the objects they select afterwards. The interfaces are animated to show the colors changing over time.The troika interfaces convey the belief that we as humans are excellent in making selections in huge sets of data if the data is presented to us in a way in which we have overview.  Think about the wanderer going up on a hilltop to determine the direction of her wanderings. She would not want to be presented with a few selected snapshots of different directions, no, she most likely prefer as much visual input as possible. The German philosopher Emmanuel Kant distinguishes between two aesthetic pleasures: beauty - pleasure derived from the small graspable things we feel we can understand; and sublimity - experiences of fear and fascination of ""endlessness"" of quantities and spaces so large that we feel we can not grasp them.

Your journey begins as the sole survivor of a terrible massacre  - you must find four pieces of evidence to bring justice to the  memory of your small village.Developed in collaboration with Los Angeles artists, teachers, writers and high school students, the game features a bilingual, thematic gameplay, accompanied by an online database of educational resource materials, source texts and imagery.Inspired by the similarly titled mural by David Alfaro Siqueiros- subsequently whitewashed in Los Angeles in 1932- Tropical America explores the causes and effects of the erasure of history. From the battles of Bolivar, to the single-crop economy of Cuba, the myth of El Dorado and the poems of Sor Juana de la Cruz, Tropical America reveals a forgotten terrain, the birthplace of contemporary cross-cultural life.The story of Rufina Amaya, sole survivor of the 1981 massacre of El Mozote in El Salvador, becomes the contextual anchor for Tropical America, and the impetus from which the game begins. El Mozote symbolizes the silencing of one people‚Äôs histories and the perseverance of its survivors to bring the events into the open.The game was produced as part of a media literacy program working withTitle I high school students around issues of violence and games, fundedprimarily by the Department of Education.

Roth's work is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art NYC and has been exhibited widely in the Americas, Europe and Asia, including the Centre Pompidou, the Kunsthalle Wien, the Tate, the Fondation Cartier and the front page of Youtube.

TSA Communication is a project that alters the airport security experience, inviting the government to learn more about passengers than just the contents of their carry on bags. Messages are cut into thin 8.5"" x 11"" sheets of stainless steel designed to comfortably fit inside airline carry on baggage. During the x-ray screening process, the technology normally designed to view the contents of a traveler's baggage is transformed into a communication tool for displaying messages aimed at airport security. The content of the plates varies from flight to flight, but includes ""NOTHING TO SEE HERE"", an image of the American flag and the TSA's (Transportation Security Agency's) mission statement as listed on its website, ""I AM THE FRONTLINE OF DEFENSE, DRAWING ON MY IMAGINATION TO CREATIVELY PROTECT AMERICA FROM HARM"". The project stems from the artist's interest in changing his role in the dance of airport security from a passive participant to an active one. Traveling with the plates has become a normal part of the artist's travel habits and he has taken the plates through airport security checkpoints over 20 times in China, the United States, France, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Italy, and Austria. Interactions with airport security are recorded with a hidden video camera. The main intention of the project is not to antagonize airport security, but rather to create a situation which seeds discourse related to personal freedoms, freedom of speech and the role of security. TSA Communication also attempts to inject conversations related to personal freedoms into the larger context of online popular culture. Humor and a polished design aesthetic are elements employed by the artist as a means towards reaching a wider online audience than just those interested in art and activism. While one portion of the project revolves around the interaction of the artist and the security agent, another critical element involves the interaction between the online documentation and the reaction of the audience on the web. TSA Communication has received hundreds of comments on top 100 blogs such as BoingBoing, Gizmodo, MAKE, Kottke and even the blog of celebrity rapper Kanye West. Online discussions surrounding the project have reached as far as the Transportation Security Administration's own web blog, titled The Evolution of Security. This blog thread received 195 comments, primarily from security workers, making it one of the most discussed posts on the TSA's website. While the hidden video camera records airline security agents reactions to the project in the real world, comments on the TSA website record agents' reactions in an online (and semi-anonymous) environment. TSA Communication is ongoing research, activism, and performance that aims to give citizens an active voice in the theater of security.",1/1/09 0:00,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/49311/,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,,1/1/09 0:00,,,Artist Terms here2211,tu eje,Sebastian,Cudicio,Sebastian Cudicio,"Keeping your visual balance was never so difficult.

Beyond the zoetrope, a larger nine scene wheel devolves/revolves a contemporary dance sequence to its historical counterparts, two early cinematic experiments made by Thomas Edison at the end of the 19th century.Through dynamic random and user-generated interaction, the dancers move in a fragmentary way. Sometimes their motion is static, and it is the degradation of the image that dances. The result is a dynamic on-screen play of image, frame and movement; a conflicted theatre or a fractured cinema of many parts.The key theme of this piece is the concept of turning (round and into), as represented on both the physical and digital stages. As the dancers pirouette, they also change form; as the digital scenes piroeutte, they similarly change form. Both echo the (illusion of) motion found in the first zoetrope scene. To create an illusion of motion, the drum is spun; the faster the rate of spin, the smoother the progression of images.  For more background on the formal styles of this work, see'Futurist Photodynamism' (Anton Giulio Bragaglia, 1st July 1913) - http://www.391.org/manifestos/antongiuliobragaglia_futuristphotodynamism.htm ;'Plastic Dynamism' (Umberto Boccioni,15th December 1913) -http://www.391.org/manifestos/umbertoboccioni_plasticdynamism.htm ; 'The Futurist Cinema' (F.T.

Their Alpha brainwave (8-10 cicles/second) is measured in amplitude in order to assess the mental state and the level of relax and concentration of the two participants, while the players‚Äô brain activity is rendered in real time as visuals on the big screen behind them and as spatialized sounds surrounding the environment. The two players quickly realize that the narration of the imagery is directly driven by their brain activity. They also realize they can continue the journey only forc- ing themselves in an emphatic relation: shifting  between chaos and organization, they constantly have to renegoti- ate their own mind states in order to let the narration go- ing on, in an unceasing research of a shared balance. As the journey goes on, visual and sonic stimulis in- crease: the players watch the evocative imagery gener- ated on the screen, and at the same time they are forced to focus on their own immer insights to keep the state of empathy and let the narration going on. Maintaining a balance become more and more difficult: ‚Äúdriving‚Äù the journey requires an ever demanding stress and increasing synergics, until the end of the game.. How much empathy do we need to face with the voyage that humanity undertook? Only those who are able to ‚Äútravel‚Äù together will finish the game ... The journey of An Unstable Empathy is the one every man pursues when immersed in his inner world and when empathetically engages himself in the emotions of the other. Above all, An Unstable Empathy shows to the users the difficulty to keep control over his own emotions and inner states. Beside that, it also seek to overcome the mental barri- ers between the people, urging to tune his Self and the its own feelings according to the other‚Äôs emotions, in an attempt to get rid of preconceptions or biases concerning the interpersonal relation and giving back to the emotion its deep transactional value in the relationship with the others and the surrounding environment. An Unstable Empathy engages the languages and tech- niques of both interactive installations and live media performances embracing them under the same experience: the interactivity between the two participants is paired by the linear narrative of the visuals on the big screen re- sembling the cinema‚Äôs fruition modalities. Furthermore the two players are both performers and spectators: the show is literally generated by their own minds. The real-time generative visuals are always different and even with the same player will be virtually impossible to see twice the same sequence, while the sound generat- ed is the direct consequence of brain activity, constantly changing.Empathy is the capacity to recognize or understand the state of mind or emotion of another person. It is often characterized as the ability to ‚Äúput oneself into another‚Äôs shoes‚Äù, or to in some way to experience the outlook or emotions of another being within oneself. It may be described metaphorically as an emotional kind of resonance or mirroring. Research in recent years has focused on possible brain processes as neural correlates of empathy (Preston & de Waal, 2002). Functional magnetic resonance imag- ing (fMRI) has recently been employed to investigate the functional anatomy of empathy (for reviews see Decety & Jackson, 2006; Decety & Lamm, 2006; deVignemont & Singer, 2006). These studies have shown that observing another per- son‚Äôs emotional state activates parts of the neuronal network involved in the processing of that same state in oneself, either for disgust (Wicker et al., 2003), touch (Keysers et al., 2004), or pain (Morrison et al., 2004; Jackson et al., 2005, 2006; Lamm et al., 2007; Singer et al., 2004, 2006; Gu & Han, 2007). The study of empathic neuronal circuitries was inspired by the discovery of mirror neurons in monkeys that fire both when the creature watches another perform an ac- tion as well as when they perform that action. Mirror neurons represents a possible neural mechanism for mapping others‚Äô feelings onto one‚Äôs own nervous sys- tem. Based on some of this work, the simulation theory of em- pathy has been developed during the past decade. In An unstable Empathy, the individual state of emotive and attentional activation is measured by an important and well known psychophysiological index: Alpha wave amplitude. This index, easily and precisely measurable by simple EEG equipments, has been often employed in various neurofeedback techniques, since the human ability to indirectly control it, intervening on the individual level of relax or activation (For an introductive review see Batty et al., 2006). Moreover, due to his relatively short times of variation and his easily of recording, Alpha brainwaves have been extensively employed in interactive installation and live performances and to drive visual or acoustic representa- tions (Brouse et al., 2006; Filatriau et al., 2006). ‚Äúthe brain is just the weight of God, for, lift them, pound for pound, and they will differ, if they do, as syllabe from sound‚Äù Emily Dickinson",10/4/10 0:00,http://www.mattiacasalegno.net/index.php?/projects/unstable-empathy/,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,,10/4/10 0:00,,,"Artistic collaboration, brain activity, brainwaves, Conceptual art, eeg, Generative art, Interactive art, interactive installation, neurosciences, partecipative game"41123,Unstable portrait of Joseph Goebbels,Aleksandar,Maƒáa≈°ev,Aleksandar Macasev,"Besides the Catholic church , which used quite elaborate principles in its counter reformation campaign, Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi Minister of Propaganda, was the first to form principles of contemporary propaganda.

Sometimes in containers, sometimes piled, the stones in the gallery represented a far away location without resembling it. Something of New Jersey, Smithson maintained, was held in those rocks and their displacement resulted in the expansion of the original site, both physically and conceptually. The Site Non-Site dialectic, as Smithson called it, feels particularly familiar today as our daily lives are continually reshaped by place-defying technologies in communication, information and travel.With Untitled (plate tectonics), Andy Graydon similarly explores the physical dimensions of location in contrast to its perception. After obtaining the ambient sounds of eleven ‚Äúnatural‚Äù art locations in New York - museums, fairs, galleries - Graydon cut the recordings onto unique acetate phonograph records, dubplates, that allow visitors to reshape PROGRAM‚Äôs gallery space with sound. Environment is used as a material. Replaying the sounds of these New York institutions as they intermix with the ambient sounds of PROGRAM, space is at once extended and collapsed. Dubplates, for the music industry, are used in mastering studios before the final master. They are meant for temporary use, they deteriorate over time. The sounds recorded on their surface begin to dissolve after about fifty plays.  / / / / /  Artist's statement:What is a visitor to the Met doing when she views the Greek sculpture garden almost exclusively through the LCD panel of her camera? What kind of experience is being produced? It is a familiar lament that our culture is losing its ability to attend, to look with engagement at art and at everyday experience. But that lament overlooks a compeling fact: the visitor is composing.In those photos, sounds, or videos, the art and the surrounding space are collapsed together (i.e. onto a picture plane) and rendered plastic, malleable, in a sense modular. Most importantly they are incorporated into the world of the viewer, rather than the reverse. In this sense there are few more democratic gestures in an exhibition than to point a device and make a recording, not to preserve a record of the place, but to impose upon it a unique continuity, a contour of one's own experience; to sculpt with it.A museum or exhibition space aims to present a coherent itinerary of (largely visual) experience. Sound tends to tell a different story, revealing places and intervals that are disruptive, distracted, intense, or diffuse, but rarely discrete. Indeed, sound abhors discretion. It can only exist through disruption and agitation. Sound is inclusive and immersive: if you hear it, it is vibrating you. This helps to explain the conflicted relationship contemporary art exhibition has had with sound work, in which playing pieces on headphones has become the favored way of taming sound into an ideally discrete sound-object.With this in mind, Untitled (plate tectonics) works with the exhibition space (both recorded and present) not as a resolved environment for the reception and contemplation of works, but rather as both an impulse (as in electrical energy) and as a material, a moldable substance useful in the creation of other ideas, further experiences, alternate places.",9/10/09 0:00,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/49389/Final_Report.pdf,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/49389/Final_Report.pdf,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,,9/10/09 0:00,,,"acetate, Acoustic Ecology, ad reinhardt, andrea williams, Andy Warhol, Appropriation, architecture, archive, art spaces, Artistic collaboration, aural architecture, ben owen, Berlin, Conceptual art, creative commons, Database, decay, dubplates, dubplates and mastering, dynamic processes, dynamic systems, Ecology, environment, Environmental Art, fair use, field recording, guggenheim museum, installation, Intellectual Property, Interactive art, lock groove, metropolitan museum, moma, Montage, museum of chinese in america, Museum of Modern Art, Museum of Natural History, museum of the city of new york, new museum, New York City, new york public library, Off-line, Olafur Eliasson, pe lang, phonography, program, PS1, public domain, richard garet, Robert Smithson, sawako, science fiction ecology, Scope Art Fair, sound, sound art, spatial intervention, transformations, unmonumental, Whitney Museum"54020,Untitled (Standards),Michael,Guidetti,Michael Guidetti,"In Untitled (Standards) Guidetti presents cultural artifacts of  3D modeling and computer graphics.

This is an important concept in many aspects of our lives. I incorporate this idea in some way in every work.Balance is found in the concept of translation. Physical space and movement provide the context of the interaction. What needs to be underscored is the viewer and the piece share the same space. The qualities of the physical space affect the nature of how they move through it. When seeking a balanced, give-and-take relationship between viewer and machine, movement should be complimentary. Often this means one side adapts to the other. What is enticing about working with these fundamentals is that I can tip the scales in a myriad of ways to create tension. The work can enter or present unexpected or priviledged spaces; it can get in peoples' personal spaces or disrupt their movement. The translation it presents can be a challenge, a compliment, an insult, or can be hidden at first, waiting to be discovered.I mentioned ‚Äúpersonal space‚Äù. All the elements I have discussed, the give-and-take relationship, the movements, the input, and the tension, combine not just into a conversation but a space in and of itself. And when I create that, record it and present it in a gallery, I invert the space and make it recursive. For example, with UDv1, the presentation of that space does not occupy the wall exclusively: incorporating the UDv1 device with its camera and screen directed at the viewer, the work creates a new space, an interactive space that runs an interactive space inside itself. Therefore, this becomes a unified experience, one thing the viewer enters. In the gallery, the viewer is interacting with UDv1, but this viewer is also walking on the street because the work is also on the street and they are in the work.",4/22/05 0:00,http://www.robertwatson.ca/documentation/udv1/,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"Date created: 2005-04-22Date created: 2005-04-22",4/22/05 0:00,,,"Alexandre Castonguay, Artengine, Artengine Lab, artengine.ca, body, By-ward Market, Byward Market, canada, collider, contextual, Drawing the Line, Event, events.robertwatson.ca, Flash, Gridflow, HTML, immersion, installation, interact, Kinga Araya, Locus Suspectus, LS Magazine, lsmagazine.ca, National Gallery of Canada, offline, Ontario, Ottawa, Participatory, Perambulations, performance, Public Art Conspiracy, public space, Puredata, QuickTime, robertwatson.ca, Rock Show Analysis, SAW, SAW Gallery, Shaun Elie, social space, space, Tungda Brown, UDv1, University of Ottawa, Urban Projections, US Embassy, video, Zygote"3475,Urban Fragments,Juliana,Sato Yamashita,Juliana Sato Yamashita,Urban Fragments was made after a proposal for my final undergraduate project for the School of Architecture and Urbanism of the University of S,12/14/02 3:57,http://sites.uol.com.br/sunaoy/urbanfragments/version5/,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/3475/urbanfragments/index.html,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: city, fragmentsDate created: 2002-02",12/14/02 3:57,,,"3D, Animation, Brazil, Documentary, Flash, HTML, interact, interface, Invisible Cities, Italo Calvino, Juliana Sato, Participatory, Sao Paulo, Third World, Visual"4084,Urban.early sunday morning_raw,Wilfried,Agricola de Cologne,Wilfried Agricola de Cologne,"As a multi-dsciplinary media artist operating from Cologne (Germany), I've been working freelance since I finished my studies in 1979. In the beginning, I worked with 'traditional' media as painting. But I was always looking for new artistic challenges. One working phase dedicated to another medium followed. Later, I came consequently  to the development of spatial installations including different media, as photography, multi-media and computer.I would like to call the time of working until 1998 as the classical phase, since  I was working with (meanwhile) classical media, even though it was always a kind of experimental work; I was always searching for the limits in using the media and in creating new contents. More than 100 individual exhibtions in cooperation with more than 70 museums throughout Europe were resulting from this phase.At the end of 1998, came a break in my life which finished this very successful period and the connected artistic career.It was in 2000, when I started a comeback as an artist, which meant to me a new life and a new artistic carreer since I was focussing now nearly my entire working on New Media and Internet, not or less in a commercial, but rather an artistic sense.The basis formed my wide experience in nearly all visual media, but also other artistic media and disciplines as music (I played for over 15 year violine and studied classical singing once during several years), performance (I was a student in an actor's school for a certain periode, took lessons in classical dancing and pantomime) and an intellectual basis through studies of art history, journalism and dramatic arts, later came a profound knowledge of computer languages and new media technologies, so that I was predestined to create multi-media works and executing all disciplines in responsability of my own, and a certain talent for organizing and the eagerness to learn and to move on innovative fields.This new environment of Internet gave me for the first time the chances to incorporate all my different talents into a variety of projects. On 01.01. 2000, I started the development of NewMediaArtProjectNetwork and its (currently) seven corporate member sites.This project represents, on one hand, a gigantic art project which can be compared with the Universe and its galaxy systems, always changing and expanding. On the other hand, it represents the framework of the network and communication between the sites, participants and collaborating individuals, institutions of different kind and the active user. To him/her this art working is addressed, network as artworking.The project as a whole is created in Flash, which represents an intuitive developing environment, offering all kind of representations and a high artistic freedom, if this can be stated at all, in this technology based environment.A project, like NewMediaArtProjectNetwork, cannot be planned, and it was not planned, thus.It developed from the creation and online publication of ""A Virtual Memorial"" www.a-virtual-memorial.org  - a project which comes from the heart and is deeply connected with my personal history.See also... http://www.a-virtual-memorial.org/artsites/a_virtual_memorial.htm and http://www.a-virtual-memorial.org/bubis/documentation.htm or conception for download as PDF http://www.a-virtual-memorial.org/downloads/pdf/pdf.htmSince the first day online, the project took an unusual attraction and received an a non-expected interest particularly in English speaking countries.In the beginning, I started bilingual (English and German), but since I became aware that my intensions where actually directed to a global community, I reduced the aspect of German (and thus, this locally limited) language and publish at present nearly exclusively in English, which is actually also the 'real' language of electronic writing.The project has a typical Internet feature, it is ongoing. Each month a new project version is published showing new features, new subjects and new multi-media works connected to the subjects.The project changes its appearance and design continuously. It is made for users who visit the site more than once, and at best frequently.The success and the feedback on this project encouraged me to create new and different project environments,  besides A Virtual Memorial ",6/15/02 0:00,http://www.nmartproject.net/agricola/mpc/volume6/urban.html,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/4084/urban.html,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: urbanDate created: 2002-06-15Date cloned: 2013-02-07",6/15/02 0:00,,,"allegory, Animation, Conceptual, digital, Flash, Formalist, Milan, Narrative, netart, video, Visual"6735,US Department of Art & Technology,Randall,Packer,Randall Packer,"The US Department of Art and Technology is the principal conduit for facilitating the artist's need to extend aesthetic inquiry into the broader culture where ideas become real action.

This project has been realised for a new Cultural Centre in Sint oedenrode (NL). The design of this installation is fully integrated with the aesthetics of this contemporary new building. The video- projection is visible every evening until 23.00 hours.Olga Mink developed this concept in an attempt to reinterpret perception of art in public space. Interactivity is a crucial part of this installation, and is accomplished via Internet and a touch-screen. The increased popularity of live visuals inspired her to put this new medium in a different context. Here the spectator is invited to take part in manipulating the output of the image. The creation of a real synergy between image, light and the environment made this project even more of a challenge.The projection is visible from both inside and outside the building. In the main hall a touch-screen can be controlled in order to manipulate the video-images. Online access can be obtained via http://www.video-matic.nl and a VJ-mix can be created in order to upload the results to the server in Sint Oedenrode.

This process results in the string being converted into a seemingly random series of characters which is, in fact, unique. Videogrid drew inspiration from this and applied the same idea to video. The user can type a word on the keyboard which is converted into events on a timeline and upon playback, each event triggers a certain piece of film. The theory being that the same four letter word will always produce an abstract, but unique, video sequence. This has now been expanded further so video clips can be swapped around and speeded up at will, breaking away from the original encryption idea and turning it into an online video sequencer controlled by words.

STATEMENTThe connecting thread among much of my current work is that a computer was involved somehow in the creative process, either in a compositional fashion or as a compositing tool for ""handmade"" images. This rather pragmatic analysis has led me to cognify a digitality in the the work that has become a formative part of my aesthetic of some, but not all works, specifically a body of works I am calling ""Volumetric Gestures"".The visual language of these works speaks in terms of the bitmap and the vector as well as form, line, gesture, and action; the aesthetic could be called ""digitalist"" perhaps, since ""digital"" simply describes a binary transcription.After completing a series of images working with 3D wireframe chalice forms, I was introduced by art historian Andrew Hershberger to the wireframe goblets of Paolo Ucello, hand-drawn in pencil with machinelike precision by the artist in 1450. This closed a circle for me, and made me realize the circularity and connectedness of time and thought.In the incorporation of technology-based art media in my studio practice, I feel there is a new modernism which I seek; one which escapes the postmodern loop and lives in the moment, a place beyond context.

Deeply rooted is a dark-sided element:  Violence. In happy surroundings, it becomes hardly visible and in less happy surroundings - either of a physical, psychological, environmental, ideological, economic or political nature  - nearly automatically a kind of survival strategy with all the known consequences we see manifested in conflicts on a small or large scale. Violence is present anywhere, hidden or sleeping, hesitating, waiting or in action, starting from simple mobbing via verbalor physical attacks, the bandwidth has no end.Nowadays, globalization, social injustice, unemployment, increasing wealth on one side and on the opposite increasing poverty (without mentioning some causes) produce a climate where violence has a fertile soil.  From the attack on 9/11 in the USA, people from the Western civilization became painfully aware that security of any kind is a mere illusion; not only the internal, but also the external enemy is present anywhere.Artists are said to be the consciousness of a nation or society as they reflect the actual state of the psychological and physical environment. When this state is penetrated by violence, nobody is surprised that violence becomes a universal subject for artistic reflection, the difference may only be the view on it and its perception depending on the respective cultural background.'Art and violence both seem to stem from the abstract: that place beyond logic, the realm of the emotion. When they intersect we are simultaneously repelled and attracted, frightened and excited. Historically this meeting has been wrought with complexity, and as cultural violence in every society increases, we are prevented by paranoia, censorship and ethical demands from asking, and sometimes even posing, some of the most important questions violence and art together and separately produce: how is violence represented, and what or how much of it do we need to resist the cultivation of fear and the encouragement of dependency? Is violence a tool, a process or a result? When are artistic portrayals of violence justifiable? As intellectual exercise, ritual, or spiritual enhancement? For other purposes? Or are they never justifiable? Is violence in art an action, reaction, or reflection? 'How different the results of an artistic reflection can be is shown through the Violence Online Festival, a New Media online exhibition project curated and organized as an individual event by Agricola de Cologne including more than 150 artists from 30 countries presenting their work. It forms a dynamic collaborative art work presenting very individual visions and use of media.The relevance of violence becomes visible also through the high quality standard of  all the included works. Each of them represents another aspect of violence - caught in textual poetry, running as a video or embedded in an interactive environment of a net-based art work.In reaction to the key role (mass) media plays by displaying and even promoting violence, a new environment (interface) has been created for Violence Online Festival, which houses and hosts the art works within a virtual media company named ""Violence Media Incorporated"". By dividing the company into different departments (eg. ""Violence for Happiness"" , ""Violence Marketing"" or ""Violence Broadcasting""), it becomes clear that their meaning has a rather ironic or sarcastic character, which gives the embedded art works a new meaning.While surfing through this environment, the visitor is forced to ask and give answers,  and becomes slowly a part of this network of art through his reflections and changes of perception.Initiated for ""Violens Festival"" Tabor (Czech Republic) in August 2002, it is meanwhile further developed as an ongoing art event to be presented in future physical and virtual exhibitions and festivals. For each new event a new project version will be created, updated and changed.Violence Online Festival is presented in 2002 on:Violens Festival Tabor (CZ)A Virtual Memorial - www.a-virtual-memorial.orgLiberarti Festival/Liverpool Biennale (UK)Computer Space Festival 2002 Sofia (Bulgaria)",8/17/02 0:00,http://www.newmediafest.org/violence/index.htm,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/7503/www.newmediafest.org/violence/index.html,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: festivalDate created: 2002-08-17Date cloned: 2013-03-07",8/17/02 0:00,,,"allegory, Animation, audio, Collaborative, collider, Conceptual, Database, exhibition, Fatima Lasay, Flash, HTML, interact, Javascript, Manila, MP3, network, QuickTime, RealPlayer, Shockwave, Tabor (CZ), video, Violens Festival Tabor (CZ), Visual"24486,virlab - experiment viruses choreographies,gr√©goire,zab√©,gr√©goire zab√©,"VIRLABVirlab is a web3D experimentation about viruses choreographies.

I aim to achieve an overlapping relationship with aesthetic representations of data and scientific empiricism. My work strives to display relationships and correlations within information systems that would remain unseen from any other perspective.In contrast to many information technology artworks that attempt to transform data into purely visually aesthetic pieces, I strive to create design systems that transpose information into temporal forms specifically for the purpose of dovetailing cognition into a visual task. The decentralized natures of the systems I create allow them to take on a visual representation in an emerging manner that truly reflects the structure of the data they represent.The projects I produce also deal with issues of interaction design with information systems and their affect on the cognitive response of the viewers. This involves procuring publicly available data sets and re-inventing their display to promote readability and simplicity. I find something interesting about the somewhat covert re-arrangement and display of information, since it places the control over interaction on the clients side rather than relying on someone else's interface.Most of my work surrounds the idea of improving human/information interface. Many people have negative reactions towards technology and information because of their experiences with poorly designed interfaces. A negative experience with an information interface most often results in frustration, anxiety, and confusion. A positive experience most often results in intuitive interaction, heightened understanding of the subject, and even leads to further investigation. By improving the interface, the experience of the interaction is improved along with it. Life is comprised of experiences, positive and negative, and by improving one experience at a time life can be made a little better. Visual Rhizome is a thesis project by Aaron Siegel for the degree of BFA in Digital Media Art from the CADRE Laboratory for New Media and the Art & Design department of San Jose State University.Rhizome.org is a highly regarded database of new media art work, constantly updating and evolving its collection.

It proposes a navegation as the process to track voices and sounds of Colombian prisoners in British jails, and female inmates of the El Buen Pastor house of detention in Bogot√°. The development of this interactive starts from efforts to channel a voice and to provide a stage that should fit the complexity of communications in and from a state of confinement. The space that this interface explores grows out of the experience I had as I conceived and realized the basic elements of the installation Voz/resonancias de la prisi√≥n: interactivity with the body, in order to generate the auditory event; a run through each hall under a specific period of time urged upon the visitor‚Äôs attention; and an encounter with video projections adjusted to the rear end of each hall, producing an infinite duplication of the space. All of those components construct a narrative that points to impossibility and blindness. As there are no available documents that make the prison‚Äôs interior visible, the sound and the searching action draw a route that stops being physical to enter into the complexity of what is mentioned, contained, negated and confined there. Time after time, the journey takes the navigators to a dead end, since they are never able to enter the prison, and thus cannot but recognize their own isolation and confinement, as well as the scarcity of the response. Utilizing such a platform, VOZ/net brings the simultaneity of sound and image, voice and text into further closeness, by means of a programming that forces us to face the wall over and over. These basic elements are supported and interconnected by a storyboard, which incorporates further hidden navigations and at the same time cross-pollinates them with experiences of the piece that are presented off the Web.  *Interface design, Boris Ter√°n.",10/17/07 0:00,http://www.quiasma.org/clemenciaecheverri/voz/fla/voz_intro.htm,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,Inventory notes: 2011-07-26 (ellen) Site no longer hosted on artist server.

With this project, so long that we manage to integrate in it an artistic side, we intend to bring the masses closer to a less than common means of expression for most. Yet another point to focus on is the possible association to a typical conception of art of the XX century: art as intervention. The most obvious indication of this is the use of a wall as canvas. Bearing in mind that it is not unusual to find walls with ‚Äúrebellious‚Äù manifestations on them, on this project, even though the canvas is the same, a much more ecological ink is used: light.Being a distributed application, accessible through the Internet, the physical barriers of artistic intervention are eliminated, for there is no need to have the ‚Äúartist‚Äù present at the physical location where the canvas is being projected upon while creation is occurring.The use of a temperature sensor (which gives direct feedback to the application) and a sonar as conditioners of expression and visualization of the interventions is sure to give dynamic character to the project. Since there is no possibility to alter the physical conditions of the place where the artists are located, the physical conditions of the canvas location are reflected on the virtual palette.Lastly, we were thrilled by the idea of having multiple ""artists"" sharing the same canvas at the same time. This canvas on most cases will be the only way for them to contact one another.",1/12/07 0:00,http://www.wallright.com,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"Date created: 2007-01-12Date created: 2007-01-12",1/12/07 0:00,,,"art world, aveiro, Collaborative, Database, DeCA, Diana Antunes, digital, Flash, Fl√É¬°via Neves, Generative, installation, Internet, Jo√É¬£o Filipe, Luis Confraria, netart, network, NTC, Nuno Caldeira, Participatory, social space, Universidade de Aveiro, Visual"32909,Want & Need,L√©on,Cullinane,C6,"Today Want & Need have become confused.

In my installation, I consider a new tradition of mediation that did not exist when the essay was written in 1980. One in which we point our webcams at animals and then use our internet browsers to watch them.

In Wish boredomresearch use a simple physics simulation to revisit the eastern myth of the Lam Tsuen Wishing Trees in Hong Kong. Visitors to these trees write their wish on a yellow paper tied to an orange. Then they try their luck at getting it to hang on one of the branches of the wishing tree. If your wish hangs in the tree it will come true, if not the myth claims that you have made your wish too greedy.Visitors to the online wishing tree can attempt to cast a wish onto a tree generated in software. After they have typed their wish they click, stretch and ping then watch and wait as it flies through the air. Should they be successful their wish will sit by others on the tree. Otherwise, wishes missing all branches fall to the floor scattering their individual characters to the dust. Visitors may also like to take the time to explore wishes left by other users. By clicking and stretching the hanging ribbons you release a stream of characters into the air which aggregate momentarily to reveal a wish before dissipating and allowing each character to drift off the screen.The database technology used allows us to store but not grant successful wishes. As one user wishfully submits to the tree ‚ÄúI wish that my wish would really become reality by casting it into a computer‚Äù they note our inability to write wish granting software. In the case of the wishing tree we add weight and gravity to that which is weightless ethereal and of the mind. Unlike the real tree the weight and gravity are simulated and our belief suspended only momentarily.The domain of web technology is normally geared towards speed and efficiency. In Wish we use a simple physics simulation to build in a time consuming inefficiency that cuts against the web technologist normal preoccupation with speed and efficiency. In turn we add an element of chance hope and intrigue to what is effectively a very simple message board.In addition to the physics based interface boredomresearch developed new interactive generative software to recreates the decrepit appearance of fruit trees seen in Japanese Edo Period Paintings (1600-1868) and a 2D renderer that displayed a stylized graphic representation of these tree structures. Visitors to the wishing tree are encouraged to leave a little of them self behind and overtime the tree blossoms with the loves losses fears and desires of its community. The sensitive aesthetics, imaginative interaction, combined with sometimes trivial, often moving, messages combine in a poetic expression of our shared humanity.Examples of user‚Äôs wishes left on Wish:‚ÄúI wish for my dream job...dream life‚Ä¶.dream man and world peace‚Äù‚ÄúI wish I hadn‚Äôt eaten so much curry‚Äù‚ÄúI wish I had the patience to persevere a little longer!‚Äù‚ÄúI wish the cards were right‚Äù‚ÄúI wish that murderers were easier to cuddle at night‚ÄùThis version of Wish is the second edition created for the ComputerFineArts.com collection.

The plan is preventive in orientation and emphasizes interactive multimedia to raise awareness; reducing breeding sites; surveillance of mosquitoes[live larvae cam], birds, mammals and humans; and public education through site-specific performance events, new media, and environments.DOHMH Commissioner Thomas R. Frieden, MD, MPH, said, ""In the City's four years experience with West Nile virus (WNV), the last week of August has tended to be the time when most new infections occur. However, with warmer temperatures expected, we are not out of the woods yet. All New Yorkers - especially those over the age of 50 - should continue to take precautions against mosquitoes, including wearing long sleeves, ensuring screens around the home are tight fitting and not torn, and consider the use of insect repellent when outdoors.""""In less than two years, New York City has developed a state-of-the-art program to protect the City from West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne diseases,"" but this does little to soothe the concerns of wnvirus.com. This problem is being viewed locally as a NY state issue, where in reality,the issues are global.What if vector-borne viruses were to ""migrate"" to Florida, and/or other wetland communities in more subtropical climate regions in the United States,with extremely long breeding seasons where it would be virtually impossible to control the disease? Well it has. ""Since the first appearance of West Nile virus here in 1999, WNVIRUS.COM has done considerable research to effectively monitor, control, and disseminate information about the disease,through public and online live performances,extreme multimedia, and art installations/environments,"" yet the general public knows so very little about the lifecycles of vectors, transmission of the disease,and the signs of infection. This is why we believe the interactive rich-media web site will be heavily viewed and extremly successful in spreading information of the disease to those whom might not otherwise be searching for it, and particularily emphasizing the importance of the impacts of such vector-borne viruses on a global scale. And more importantly blurring the boundaries between all media by implementing a unique fusion of the arts with 'real and relevant issues/content' created to utilize internet delivery technologies.The various components of the WNVIRUS.COM plan are as follows:Prevention of Mosquito Breeding//[new] FORMS FOR REPORTING STANDING WATER[MOSQUITO BREEDING SITES],AND DEAD BIRD REPORT FORMS TO NOTIFY THE CDC[centers for disease control] OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS,HAVE BEEN ADDED TO WNVIRUS.COM//WNVIRUS.COM will collaborate with elected officials, other agencies and urban communities to eliminate standing water in empty lots, tire piles and other containers. This will be augmented by performing audio/visual performances in potential breeding sites across the city. A public information campaign will urge residents to reduce breeding sites around homes and businesses, and to report major potential mosquito breeding sites. Additionally, to create original artworks, and venues to exhibit original works[all mediums], that deal with these type of local issues.The identification of an infected bird or mosquito, or an increase in the density of dead bird sightings, will trigger a ""rapid response."" This will include intensively reducing larval habitats, and increasing larval control to contain amplification of the virus before it impacts human health.WNVIRUS.com the portal will function as a  launch pad to all relative vital breaking news stories surrounding the event.Mosquito SurveillanceWNVIRUS will monitor mosquitoes citywide by collecting mosquito larvae and adult mosquitoes to determine their distribution, density and type. In 2001, WNV will test adult mosquitoes collected in New York City for West Nile and related viruses in its own laboratories. With testing taking place locally in 2001, the time it will take to get results should be significantly reduced, allowing for more rapid public notification and mosquito breeding reduction activities. Additionally, the public can take part in these laboratory experiments by viewing the specimens and procedures through the live larvae interent camera.WNV will inspect known mosquito breeding sites within our neighborhoods weekly to determine the presence of mosquito larvae.Bird and Mammal Surveillance.Animals will be monitored for infection and illness with a focus primarily on dead birds, our rooftop pigeon coup access will be instrumental in the collection of infected birds.. WNV also will monitor disease among pigeons,and pigeon flyers throughout NY will be asked to report animals with suspected neurological illnesses to WNV. Additionally,WNV will ask the public to report the number, location, and types of dead birds via telephone (1-877-WNV-4NYC) or via WNVIRUS.COM Dead bird reports will be used as markers for possible West Nile activity.Birds which have died recently, will be retrieved if DOH can confirm the location of the bird with the reporting party and can gain access for retrieval. The public will be advised to safely discard birds that are not being retrieved by the City. A sample of birds, especially crows and bluejays, that have died within the 24 hours before reporting, will be submitted for testing in accordance with NYSDEC and NYSDOH criteria.Public Education and Community OutreachThe WNV will continue its multi-media WNVIRUS.COM ""emergenceNYC"" public education campaign,refering to the emergence of the adult mosquito from his previous larval confines.. This year, the campaign will include borough specific calls to action (e.g., ""emerge"" Staten Island, the Bronx, etc). Campaign components will include stickers with web adress to be placed in buses, subways, billboards and sanitation trucks as well as public education materials (in multiple languages) to be distributed citywide; and radio and television public service announcements. Brochures and fact sheets in several languages will be distributed to community-based organizations, community boards, elected officials, schools, and many other organizations citywide. The automated West Nile Virus information Line (1-917-781-3929) will be regularly updated.In the event of significant human disease risk that may require the application of pesticides to control adult mosquitoes, accurate and timely information about mosquito control activities will be provided. WNVIRUS.COM will provide information about application scheduling, the type of pesticides being used and how to reduce exposure. Additionally,the public will be informed about what to do in the event of adverse reactions to pesticides.An artist led ""WNVIRUS PERFORMANCE PROJECT,"" will travel to communities to disseminate information on West Nile virus and related activities.Adult Mosquito ControlWNV will implement a phased response to surveillance findings that will expand prevention and control activities in relation to the threat of an outbreak of human disease. If surveillance indicators suggest that the level of West Nile viral activity poses a significant threat to human health, the plan involves considering the use of pesticides that kill adult mosquiitoes. Because green areas play a role in the amplification of the virus, they may be priority for spraying in high risk areas.2001 WNVIRUS.COM Comprehensive Arthropod Surveillance and Control PlanAppendix: Guidelines for a Phased Response to West Nile Virus SurveillanceFindings[disneyNASAborg][MEDIAMIXER].nychttp://WWW.SINTELLIGENCE.NETdnasab@sintelligence.netICQ#106074988+1.917.721.4437",6/1/99 0:00,http://www.wnvirus.com/,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: vector-borne virus,transmission,infectionDate created: 1999-06-01",6/1/99 0:00,,,"Animation, Anti-art, audio, bio, Centers For Disease Control, Collaborative, Conceptual, education, Flash, HTML, Java, media activism, MP3, nature, NYC, performance, public space, QuickTime, RealPlayer, Shockwave, sintelligence.net, Smack Mellon Arts Center, tactical, tactical media, video"31723,Women: Memory of Repression in Argentina,Wilfried,Agricola de Cologne,Wilfried Agricola de Cologne,"Women: Memory of Repression in Argentinacuratorial environment by Agricola de Cologne & Raquel PartnoyThe project is referring to the  thirty thousands of  persons who disappeared during the military dictatorships of the 20th century  in Argentina, a war of the military against the own population, a genocide, which is also called ""Argentine holocaust"".These disappeared were mainly  members of a family like sons and fathers/husbands,intellectuals and different minded, but many of them also Jews.Only the resistance of courageous women, the mothers, better known as ""Mother of Plaza de Mayo"" against the military regime changed the country profoundly by organising demonstrations in order to get the answers what happened to their sons and husbands.Raquel Partnoy, herself one of the mothers who lost a son and whose daughter was persecuted and imprisoned,  is collaborating as a co-curator.The project contains a number of authentic testimonies, a portrait of the Jewish family Partnoy who emigrated in the beginning of the 20th century from Europe to Argentina, a documentary which gives an idea how family structure were systematically destroyed while the military were ruling, further a number of young Argentine female New Media artists who  deal with this traumatic memory manifested in their net based art works, curated by Agricola de Cologne, by name Irene Coremberg, Marina Zerbarini, Anahi Caceres and her Arte UNa network and Andamio Contiguo, an artists collaborative.During many decades only the demonstrations of the mothers kept vivid  the memory of the disappeared, and most of the cases could not be cleared up until these days and remained a national trauma.Only these days and under more democratic conditions, there is slowly starting a general movement to reflect the period of the military juntas. The project stands in the context of these recent developments in Argentina.The genocide stands in one line with the genocide on the Jews in Nazi Germany, on the different minded in Stalinist Russia, the moslems in former Yugoslavia,the intellectuals in Cambodia and many more. If the project would like to give one message, than this:What happened in Argentina must not happen again, not in this country nor at any other place on the globe.The project is created, edited and produced by Agricola de Cologne, but the collaborative and networking aspect is of essential relevance.",8/15/04 0:00,http://argentina.engad.org,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,Date created: 2004-08-15,8/15/04 0:00,,,"buenos aires, Collaborative, Conceptual, death, disappearance, Documentary, Flash, historical, HTML, identity, Javascript, Mothers of Plaza de Mayo, MP3, netart, network, Plaza de Mayo, responsibility, tactical, Text, video, Visual, War"46748,Words Of War,Ronnie,Shahmoon,Ronnie Shahmoon,"Words of War is a website that I created that is designed to show that the leadership of both sides of the war on terror use the same techniques to convine their people that they are right and that the others are wrong.  It does this by translating the rhetoric from one regime to the rhetoric of the other.  The user is able to enter any text in the rhetoric of one side of the arguement and the page will translate it to the rhetoric of the other.The page is coded in visual basic. Ever since September 11 2001, America has been gripped by the fear of terrorism.  In parts of the Middle East, America is seen as an agressor seeking only self gain in exploiting the region.  As a result there are many people on both sides who are angry with their opposition.  They cannot rest until they defeat the enemy.  This senario is neither new nor unique, the only thing that changes is the villain.Politicians thrive on pointing fingers and having someone to blame is very useful.  Words Of War demonstrates how both sides of this particular conflict use this to great effect, laying blame squarely on the opposition.  The site translates the rhetoric used by President George W Bush to that of Osama Bin Laden and vice versa.  The results are clear.  Even though the terminology is different, they are both simply projecting blame at each other.Looking for someone to blame is not going to fix the problem, it will only perpeuate it.  Seeking a peacful compromise can also be frustrating.  Neither seem to work.  This is because the unrest always remains.  The bitter aftertaste of not feeling contented soes not go away.  It would be much more productive for people to take ownership of their own discontentment and work on dealing with that before pointing yet another finger.",1/7/07 0:00,http://www.wordsofwar.com,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,Date created: 2007-01-07,1/7/07 0:00,,,", (t)error, 2001-09-11, Al kaieda, america, Bin Laden, browser, Bush, colonialism, Conceptual, fundamentalism, George W, globalization, HTML, identity, interact, Internet, media activism, New York, Osama, patriot, Pentagon, politics, publish, responsibility, rhetoric, speech, Terrorism, Text, Twin Towers, War, World Trade Center"48169,Work With Me,Ellie,Harrison,Ellie Harrison,"Work With Me is an international campaign to help find a long-term collaborative partner for Ellie Harrison.

The rise of New Media means for Virilio an important break between man and woman because of the absence of body presence.

I will consistently play the role of mouthpiece, but other times, despite my best intentions, I am not going to play quite well that role and, no doubt, someone else more apt for the job will. Briefly, it is an interactive novel in which visitors turn into characters as soon as they are reading-browsing-immersing through it if so they wish. They are also told to do things that edge on the impossible due to the available technology at present, yet the main technology visitors are meant to utilise is their brains, which often do not need any external hardware at all to achieve the so called impossible things. The website immerses visitors on a journey from reality to fiction and back in such a way that the initial reality and the unfolded fiction most times end up piercing each other. Thus it awakens the visitor to his or her own personal hyperreality. The mouthpiece (still myself so far) will also awaken to his or her hyperreality during a performance (as a character), which is meant to take place at some point in the future in a real location. The performance will recycle and revive the world of the website but in a quite different way.

What the flux?What should you do? Call the police? Pay the fine? Charge admission? With whole parts of the brain dedicated to facial recognition, it is hardly surprising that the face - my sFace, their sFace, Your sFace - perhaps the most complicated container in existence - reveals, conceals, shows, expresses, denies and lies that which lies on the other side - on the inside, that is.This morphing matrix of the dreamer inside must - like the bending tree in the wind - maintain its balance.That‚Äôs a balance between giving in to the deformations of the wind, and, that stoic architectural base that provides for the brains facade.That your very survival may fulcrum on that balance only reinforces your innate prejudices of sFaces.Ah! But some say the architecture of Your sFace - as form follows function - is simply housing the portals of your senses - as, indeed, they are. And yet, this arrangement of form falls woefully short in accounting for the bias of sFace.So let‚Äôs separate this out. The bias is in the brain, not in the sFace. The sFace flows as the brain blows. The sFAce is beautiful. Your sFace Or Mine? Anonymity is dedicated to the notion that all sFaces are beautiful - and may the neural network follow.The full Your sFace Or Mine?

AnonymityIt has been nearly 10 years since the highly interactive Your sFace or Mine? original was created. And while, at the core, it was always about the issues surrounding that most profound enigma called identity, it also called attention to the very nature of forming and exchanging the ""parts"" that make up the ""whole"" - if you will.Your sFace or Mine? Anonymity is also centered on the enigma we call identity. The upgrade gooses the interactivity-presentation by having the lead activation (mouse/touch-over) hotspot run an animation of all the choices within that respective grid. A complete and unique mix of animated and static ""parts"" awaits the viewer's input. A slideshow and a short music video demonstrate some of the possibilities. What has come to even more focus - as the ""parts"" become even more transient -  is that, while the core of the work is centered on identity, what remains throughout all the technological change and innovation is prejudice. And while these advancements take us a few steps forward to disarm such bias, it still requires us to embrace the differences to make a difference.",4/13/13 18:39,http://www.brooksdesign-ps.net/Reginald_Brooks/Code/Html/5face/netart15.htm,outside_link,,archive_URL,arr,"The work is extremely straightforward: change a part to affect the whole, only now some of the parts are animated - bringing a new dynamic and subsequent conceptualization onboard.

One character is represented by a          silhouette of a male figure, the other one by a silhouette of a female figure.           There is no story in a traditional sense. Extremely strict and ritualized movements are          executed by the two characters or multiple instances of the characters. The computer          program serves as an invisible regisseur that directs the virtual actors by controlled random          functions.          Audio and visual material are reduced to essential elements. Three different tones on both          audio channels and simple rhythm patterns direct the sensation to the spatial movement of          sound. The images are in black and white with a few accents in color to emphasize the          aesthetic of the actors' ornamental geometry. On one hand, the silhouettes of the figures          are treated as individual actors and on the other hand, the spatial arrangements and          movements of groups of figures are used as ornaments.           The same elements of the Minimal Opera are repeated in different variations. The result is          a digital mantra open to various interpretations by the viewer.           The first act's title is ""you me."" It concentrates on the two solo actors. The second part,          named ""and,"" shows mass scenes and movements. The individual characters dissolve into          ornamental patterns. ""you me and,"" the last part, mixes individual and group actions from          the first two acts into a final scene.           During the three sections the words ""you,"" ""me,"" and ""and"" appear as single words to          provide poetic metaphors for the virtual narrative in the specific act. The positions of the          actors in mass scenes are marked by numbers from 1 to 10. The numbers appear and          disappear as the figures emerge on stage.           Each act is a single scene, arising in a different browser window. If all three windows are          open, the visual-acoustic story of all three acts is permanently present. This leads to          various unpredictable mixtures and interpretations depending on the user's action of          resizing, moving, and arranging of windows. In addition to this simple customization of the          play, each act itself allows users to direct actors by changing the position of the mouse.          With this combination of high-level (moving windows, etc.) and low-level interaction (inside          a window) the user is enabled to fine tune the Minimal Opera.           Interactivity is provided as a choice, not as a must. The viewer can influence the narrative          but this active experience is not necessary to go through the piece - activity and passivity          coexist simultaneously.           The project was made possible through a commission by HotWired, the web-site of Wired          Magazine.

These three cities are soaking up memories and are fed by the book, so a new city -Zaira- is formed by their ‚Äúloss of boundary‚Äù in the mind. Calvino narrates one real city, Venice, in the whole book by dispelling her to imaginary ones; Calvino‚Äôs narrative process starts to flow again with this project realised by a reader as he wants to achieve. The openness and continuity of the book are proved by applying the method vice versa: like recreating the visuals from the text, the invisible cities are also turned into real ones. He has separated Venice to 55 texts so 55 imaginary cities are formed - but now, Zaira stores 3 real ones in her imaginary identity. ‚ÄúZaira, City of Memories‚Äù is a hypertext project: the structure is based on the book‚Äôs content table which tries to give an idea of non-linear reading to the reader.

However, as the vector information is embedded within the .swf, it can be rasterized to an infinite size without pixilation.",10/1/03 0:00,http://www.takeo.org/nspace/ns006/,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,Date created: 2003-10-01,10/1/03 0:00,,,"allegory, Conceptual, digital, Flash, Formalist, globalization, HTML, identity, language, Text, Visual"3351,]and_scape[,Wilfried,Agricola de Cologne,Wilfried Agricola de Cologne,"""]and\_scape[""Interactive moving picture created in Flash by media artist Agricola de Cologne inspired by poetic texts of Liubov Sirota, an Ukrainian Chernobyl survivor.The work is telling something about landscapesimaginary landscapes, flourishing landscapeslandscapes of illusion, landscape of hope, landscape of innocencelandscapes of being home, landscapes of unscathed geneticslandscape of giving home to all beings of the Creation.Are there any landscapes any longer, did not they dry out, blasted, shrinked to minimalism through the will for destruction, the bombs over Hiroshima, Chernobyl the completely mined enviroment which leaves no air to breath, the mountains of garbage collapsing",2/20/02 0:00,http://www.nmartproject.net/agricola/mpc/volume3/and_scape1.html,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/3351/and_scape1.html,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"Date created: 2002-02-20Date cloned: 2013-03-27",2/20/02 0:00,,,"allegory, Animation, audio, bosnia, Chernoby Poems, Chernobyl, Conceptual, death, disappearance, Flash, Formalist, Hiroshima, Liubov Sirota, memory, Narrative, utopia, Visual"4937,_][s][hut][ters][ of d.funct meat_//Shutters of Defunct Meat,mez,breeze,mez breeze,The wurk ,9/20/02 14:09,http://www.hotkey.net.au/~netwurker/shutters%20of%20meat/som.htm,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/4937/som.htm,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"Date created: 2002Date cloned: 2013-02-07",9/20/02 14:09,,,"Abstract, code.work, Conceptual, Flash, HTML, interact, interface, mezangelle, net art net.wurk, netart, network, performance, software, tactical, tactical media, Text, www.hotkey.net.au/~netwurker"23208,_____________2_____________,jimpunk,,):m,"index : ())( / )( / blank / iframe x .gif x .text / { filter: FlipH} + &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=&quot;Page-Enter&quot; CONTENT=&quot;RevealTrans (Duration=1, Transition=23)&quot;&gt;/&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=&quot;Page-Exit&quot; CONTENT=&quot;RevealTrans (Duration=1, Transition=23)&quot;&gt; / fullscreen() /&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;refresh&quot; content=&quot;9;URL=)(.html&quot;&gt;/&lt;script language=&quot;JavaScript&quot; src=&quot;.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;/1/html = _____________2_____________ ",11/9/03 0:00,http://www.jimpunk.com/_____________2_____________/,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/23208/_____________2_____________/,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,"New Keywords from user: screensaverDate created: 2003-11-09Date cloned: 2013-02-21",11/9/03 0:00,,,"Abstract, Animation, Conceptual, Generative, HTML, Internet, Javascript, jimpunk, jimpunk.com, language, live, media activism, Narrative, netart, robot, Text, underground, Visual, _____________2_____________"28465,{ Software Structures },Casey,Reas,Casey Reas,"The catalyst for this project is the work of Sol LeWitt, specifically his wall drawings. I had a simple question: ""Is the history of conceptual art relevant to the idea of software as art?"" I began to answer the question by implementing three of Lewitt's drawings in software and then making modifications.After working with the LeWitt plans, I created three structures unique to software. These software structures are text descriptions outlining dynamic relations between elements. They develop in the vague domain of image and then mature in the more defined structures of natural language before any thought is given to a specific machine implementation.Twenty-six pieces of software derived from these structures were written to isolate different components of software structures including interpretation, material, and process. For each, you may view the software, source code, and comments. As a starting point for this work, Reas asked the question: ""Is the history of conceptual art relevant to the idea of software as art?"". Through initial exercises he began to answer this question by rebuilding Sol LeWitt wall drawings via software. From this point, Reas began to develop rule based drawings in the spirit of the work, eventually producing Twenty-six dynamic, software driven drawings. I want programming to be as immediate and fluid as drawing and I work with software in a way that minimizes the technical aspects. I often spend a few days creating a core piece of technical code and then months working with it intuitively, modifying it without considering the core algorithms. I use the same code base to create myriad variations as I operate on the fundamental code structure as if it were a drawing - erasing, redrawing, reshaping lines, molding the surface through instinctual actions. In the past year, I have begun removing code from the process of creation. The concept for the work develops entirely through sketches and the final piece is an annotated written description without reference to a computational implementation. The work develops in the vague domain of image and then matures in the more defined structures of natural language before any thought is given to a specific machine implementation. I'm calling this type of program a software structure.A defining factor in this shift was the work of Sol LeWitt - specifically his wall drawings. A wall drawing is a set of instructions (a text description and optional diagram) outlining a visual structure to be executed on a wall. For example, the program for Wall Drawing #69 from 1971 reads:Lines not long, not strait, not touching, drawn at random using four colors, uniformly dispersed with maximum density, covering the entire surface of the wall.LeWitt has written hundreds of wall drawings since their origin in 1968. Each time a wall drawing is reproduced it is different depending on the site and the draftsperson. There is a complete separation of the concept of the work from its perceptual manifestation. The relation between LeWitt and his draftsperson is often compared to the relation between a composer and performer , but I think it's also valid to look at the comparison between a programmer and the entity of execution. LeWitt writes programs for people to execute and interpret rather than for machines. This difference allows him to work in natural language, rather than the limited formal languages of computer code. He is also able to leave ambiguity in his programs, as they will be executed by skilled draftspersons who are able to interpret, rather than a machine which must be told precisely what to do. This essay explores the potential influences of LeWitt's work on contemporary works of software. I have created three example software structures. To further define the concept of software structures I have written and commissioned twenty-four implementations of these structures to isolate different aspects including interpretation, material, and process.",6/3/04 0:00,http://artport.whitney.org/commissions/softwarestructures/,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_nc_sa,,6/3/04 0:00,,,"Abstract, Casey Reas, Christiane Paul, Collaborative, Conceptual, download, Flash, Jared Tarbell, Java, language, Paragraphs on Conceptual Art, Robert Hodgin, software, Sol Le Witt, Text, Visual, Whitney Artport, William Ngan, collaboration, software, process, code"31648,{matrix},Michael Takeo,Magruder,M.
