My art is very much influenced by a 21st century multi-sensory aesthetic. I draw from a wide range of disciplines; motion graphics, sound and music, poetry, performance/installation, interactive media, 3D animation, typography, and print. However I find myself consistently dealing with words. The different ways we gather textual information is exciting for me to study. I particularly enjoy studying the aesthetic differences of typography between print, animated, and interactive media. For me the most important thing for an artist or designer is the concept and I try to develop my concepts first and then find and explore the media necessary to realize them.Art should be new and exploratory. Idea driven. My work very much deals with complex concepts and the challenges of figuring out how to realize them. Initially it all stemmed from my passion for poetry, particularly visual forms of poetry and new ways of representing the visual word. My work often explores this theme.

Takeshi Murata wasn’t aware of the copyright issue when he began working on I, Popeye (2010), but it highlights the contradictions that interest him: the possibility of “unauthorized use” with images that are as deeply embedded in the popular consciousness as a song like “Happy Birthday.” Here, Murata twists a cartoon of heroic triumph into a litany of failure—the opposite of what Disney does when adapting a tale that, in the Grimms’ telling, doesn‘t end happily. The halting, minor-key version of the Popeye theme song in Devin Flynn and Ross Goldstein‘s soundtrack and the leering, moneyed Popeye pictured on the anti-hero‘s T-shirt—a caricature of pop-culture icon as commodity—are two details that contribute the video‘s effect. But the key factor is the medium itself. By rendering the characters in the kind of slick three-dimensional animation commonly associated with big-studio production, Murata intensifies and complicates the discrepancy between the official Popeye and his own “folk” version. In Europe, Popeye’s copyright expired on January 1, 2009, which means his likeness can be used in comics, on clothing, and elsewhere without authorization from the copyright holder—but only in Europe, where the law protects copyright for seventy years following the author‘s death (E.C. Segar, who first drew the spinach-guzzling sailor in 1929, died in 1938). In the United States, however, copyright stands for ninety-five years after it is first registered, so uses of Popeye will have to be registered through 2024.",3/9/12 11:21,,outside_link,http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/54085/,archive_URL,arr,,1/1/10 0:00,,,"3D, Animation, Appropriation, copyright"37853,Initiation Module,Roy,LaGrone,Roy LaGrone,"Based on a “rite of passage” scenario; the video Initiation Module depicts the artist as protagonist in a virtual initiation proceeding.

'Noumina' presents our current visual rendering of the Universe via high-quality satellite imagery from NASA, and video improvisations from the open-source planetarium software Stellarium. Framed within alternate polygonal layers, the project attunes with the lineage of expanded cinema, and pays homage to the successes of astronomy thus far.NOUMINA is part of an ongoing series of cinematic explorations of the Other, both formally and in its representation as alien encounter.
