Generative dither images, created by PhotoshopMagnified 250 pixel-wide Dithers, displayed on-screen or as large prints. The Dither Studies are collaborations with Photoshop. I give the program an impossible task: to draw a solid color or gradient with a palette of incompatible colors, thus exposing the dithering algorithm's complex, seemingly irrational patterns. Dithering is ordinarily intended to be hidden, a way of maintaining photographic realism while saving space. But by intentionally misusing it, the algorithmic unconscious that underlies the digital imagery we experience is exposed in all its complexity. The color palette, inspired by Op Art, creates dynamic patterns that appear very different from up close than from a medium distance, where the colors writhe, losing their sharp clarity. From very far away, the colors begin to fade into each other, and the viewer can get a sense of the original colors Photoshop had attempted to render.  ",1/9/12 10:53,http://danieltemkin.com/DitherStudies/,outside_link,,archive_URL,by_sa,,1/9/12 10:53,,,"generative, photoshop, misused tools"53488,GAME ARTHRITIS,IOCOSE,IOCOSE,IOCOSE and Matteo Bittanti,"What are the real effects of digital gaming to our fingers, hands, and bodies?  The conformity of interfaces produces deformity.It’s a fact.Call it “the reality of the virtual”. Prolonged vicarious aggression lead to permanent physical disfiguration. Gaming activities produce real consequences for the users. Research has been conducted for years in several clinical laboratories across the globe but doctors and researchers are not willing to share their findings with the general population.

By starting with simple geometric shapes, the process is made distinct from the source material -- the resulting images are a record of the artist's struggle with the machine. Digital data does not contain its own interpretation; it is a nebulous thing, granted a frame of reference only by the external programs that interpret it. Glitchometry abandons the protective layer these programs give, to manipulate data directly. It is both a freeing and frustrating experience.In Glitchometry, each image begins as one or a few squares or circles. They are sonified -- imported into an audio editor. Sound effects are added to individual color channels, transforming the image. Because the tools are misused, there is no immediate way to monitor the effect. The image manipulator has a sense of what each effect does (Flanger creating bands across the image, certain Reverbs creating a Moire effect), but no precise control over the result. Many factors irrelevant to sound manipulation come into effect when visuals are the output: size of the file, density of color information. It is a wrestling with the computer, taking place over many iterations on the same image.

The work portrays a crudely and inaccurately rendered version of a future New York Times front page, unrealistically featuring a lead article about the show and its exclusion of the artist. The article laments a noticeable failure of the show brought on by the artist's absence.  Shortly after turning fourteen, I created this after the lineup of artists to be featured at Dump IRL at 319 Scholes had already been announced alongside details of the show. Being an active member of Dump.fm shortly after its inception (and a notable one for my age), I felt shut out by the formal structure of the art show, something quite unfamiliar to me at the time. I made it as a humor piece, expressing confusion with the infrastructure of a gallery show and my own exclusion from this retrospective of the work that had been created on Dump.fm from its beginning in 2008. It became something else entirely and an important step for me as an artist when it was turned into a print and displayed at the very show it had preemptively claimed to be excluded from.

The rendered stones range from absurd abstractions of other worldly precious gemstones to crude forced misrepresentations of common pebbles we've kicked down dirt roads in our cliche youths. It is this polarization between 'real' and 'fake', 'honesty' and 'fantasy' which is at the crux of the work; the shortcomings and beauty of mankind's attempt to represent the handiwork of God.

This is a project of and about photography. Institutional discourse around photo­graphy remains encumbered by certain established strictures. These are intimately tied to a specific history of photography that is concerned with the camera’s status as a tool used to depict states of things in the world. This history could be said to revolve around confirming or problematizing Roland Barthes’s assertion that the medium’s essence is the ability of the photograph to testify: ‘That-has-been.’ This tends to repress, or at least discount, several integral aspects of the medium: the physical support upon which the image is registered, myriad technical processes, as well as the numerous choices that were made by the photographer in capturing the image.The photographs are Google Books images in which software distortions, the imaging site, and the hands of ScanOps employees are visible. They’re both indexical, and medium-specific. Their processes, digital manipulations, and material supports are folded within them.The hand - always the synechdoche for the worker - is occasionally inserted literally into our view of the text, presenting a persistent necessity for repetitive, manual labor.  These accidents then complicate the categorizations of “immaterial” and “informational” labor in the Information Technology sector.  ScanOps is (or was) the internal department name for Google’s onsite book scanning contractors. The ScanOps project is based on Google Books images in which software distortions, the scanning site, and the hands of ScanOps employees are visible.
